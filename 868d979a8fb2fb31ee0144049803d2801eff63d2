      "message": "The new CameraCaptureSession box looks fine - one minor issue is that the blue line for the outputs is a bit hard to track (looks a bit like it comes out of stopRepeating), but not sure how one could improve it, given all the other arrows involved.\n\nOne other (hopefully!) minor request - the blue arrow from the \u0027in-progress queue\u0027 would work better if it went to one (or all) of the output stream queue right-hand-side Image buffer boxes, instead of the header for \u0027Configured outputs\u0027.  It\u0027s suppose to indicate filled image buffers being returned from the camera device.",
