Or do we say elsewhere that the userdata partition must have a certain amount of free space?\n\nFor example, I\u0027m worried about Play Auto Installs that now plop themselves onto the data partition out of the box (after setup wizard), meaning that 1GB can quickly disappear.",

      "message": "Good question.\n\nThe userdata partition (/data) is separately called out to have at least 1.5GB (5GB for TVs) and recommended to have 3GB.\n\nThe typical set where the bare minimum is being used is on devices with 4GB flash, which also typically has 512MB RAM etc., and tends to have made the right product decision to preload less number of apps. Hopefully that mitigates the concern here, but we are with each version of the API level keep increasing this number.",
