      "message": "There\u0027s an arrow missing from \u0027Camera Base\u0027 to \u0027ICameraService\u0027.\n\nAlso, the text for this figure is a bit misleading now - it says \"and where to find the source for each\" which isn\u0027t really encoded in the diagram. Would probably get too busy to put it in - it\u0027d look more like https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19kYaYuuwtudCbkxUGwM6LdiIiz68f5chq3Vts1lt9qA/edit then.\n\nSo I\u0027d probably remove that bit of text, or we need to add more stuff to the diagram somehow.",

      "message": "This matches the source diagram, but if possible, could we update it slightly, to account for changes we made to the HAL design since the source diagram was made?\nBasically, the \u0027empty buffers\u0027 lines should go to the same place as \u0027One request per capture\u0027 - we now give the HAL a single bundle of the request and the empty buffers to fill all up front.\nThe \u0027filled buffers\u0027 lines and everything else is fine.",

      "message": "Unfortunately, the source diagram is a bit out of date here.  I\u0027m very sorry for not thinking of that sooner.\n\nIn the final API reviews for the camera2 API, the CameraDevice block was split into two (CameraDevice and CameraCaptureSession), http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCaptureSession.html.   \n\nBasically, the changes required would be:\n\n- configureOutputs is replaced with createCaptureSession, which (analogous to openCamera providing a CameraDevice) provides a CameraCaptureSession. Still take as a list of Surfaces as input.\n\n- all CameraDevice methods besides createCaptureRequest and createCaptureSession move to CameraCaptureSession.\n\n- There are some additional methods in CameraCaptureSession, but I don\u0027t think they\u0027re essential to represent here.\n\n- CameraProperties was renamed to CameraCharacteristics, and getCameraProperties() to getCameraCharacteristics().\n\n- CameraManager.getDeviceIdList() was renamed to getCameraIdList().\n\n- CameraManager.CameraListener was renamed to CameraManager.AvailabilityCallback.\n\n- CameraDevice.CaptureListener was renamed to CameraCaptureSession.CaptureCallback.\n\nOther minor stuff to fix:\n\n- The new version of the diagram renames \u0027Repeating Request List\u0027 to \u0027Pending Request List\u0027. It\u0027d be good to keep the original name to better highlight the difference between repeating requests and non-repeating ones.",
