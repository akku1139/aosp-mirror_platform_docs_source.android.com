    - heading: About the Android Open Source Project
      description: |
        Android is an open source software stack for a wide range of mobile
        devices and a corresponding open source project led by Google. This
        site and the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository offer the
        information and source code you need to create custom variants of the
        Android stack, port devices and accessories to the Android platform,
        and ensure your devices meet compatibility requirements.

        We also wanted to make sure there was no central point of failure,
        where one industry player could restrict or control the innovations of
        any other. The result is a full, production-quality operating system
        for consumer products with source code open for customization and
        porting.
