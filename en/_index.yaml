    - heading: About the Android Open Source Project
      description: |
        Android is an open source software stack for a wide range of mobile
        devices and a corresponding open source project led by Google. This
        site and the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository offer the
        information and source code you need to create custom variants of the
        Android stack, port devices and accessories to the Android platform,
        and ensure your devices meet compatibility requirements.<br><br>

        We also wanted to make sure there was no central point of failure,
        where one industry player could restrict or control the innovations of
        any other. The result is a full, production-quality operating system
        for consumer products with source code open for customization and
        porting. And now this site is available in China at <a
        href="https://source.android.google.cn/">source.android.google.cn</a>.<br><br>

        As the AOSP documentation site, we seek your contributions. With an
        ever-changing ecosystem, we need your help to stay fresh. You may make
        your own fixes directly to the source files by following the
        instructions in our <a
        href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/docs/source.android.com/+/master/README.txt">README</a>.
        You may also use the <a
        href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=191476">Site
        Feedback</a> link at the bottom of any page to report bugs and offer
        suggestions for enhancement. See the siteâ€™s <a
        href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/docs/source.android.com/+log/master?pretty=full&no-merges">changelog</a>
        for a detailed view of all updates.
