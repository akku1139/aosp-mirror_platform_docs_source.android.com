    - heading: About the Android Open Source Project
      description: |
        Android is an open source operating system for mobile devices and a
        corresponding open source project led by Google. This site and the
        Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository offer the information and
        source code needed to create custom variants of the Android OS, port
        devices and accessories to the Android platform, and ensure devices meet
        the compatibility requirements that keep the Android ecosystem a healthy
        and stable environment for millions of users.
        <br><br>
        As an open source project, Android's goal is to avoid any central point
        of failure in which one industry player can restrict or control the
        innovations of any other player. To that end, Android is a full,
        production-quality operating system for consumer products, complete with
        customizable source code that can be ported to nearly any device and
        public documentation that is available to everyone (in English at
        <a href="https://source.android.com/">source.android.com</a> and in
        Simplified Chinese at
        <a href="https://source.android.google.cn/">source.android.google.cn</a>).
        <br><br>
        Just as you can <a href="/setup/contribute/">contribute code to
        AOSP</a>, you can also contribute to AOSP documentation&mdash;and we
        want your input! Android's flexibility and ever-changing codebase means
        this site needs your feedback to keep content fresh, accurate, and
        relevant to Android implementors. We encourage you to check the
        <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/docs/source.android.com/+log/master?pretty=full&no-merges">changelog</a>
        for details on recent AOSP updates and to report bugs or offer
        suggestions using the
        <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=191476">Site
        Feedback</a> at the bottom of every page (or by visiting
