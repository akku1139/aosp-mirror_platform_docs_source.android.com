 sensor to change sampling rate </li>
  <li> another activated sensor to decrease the quality of its measurements </li>
  <li> another non-activated sensor to start delivering events </li>
</ul>
<p>Nor can any of the actions above prevent actions (activation, deactivation,
  and parameter changes) on another sensor from succeeding. For instance,
  whether we can activate the step counter must be independent of whether the
  accelerometer is currently activated. </p>
<p>As another important example, a wake-up sensor activated at 5Hz must generate events
  at around 5Hz, even if its non-wake-up variant is being activated at 100Hz.</p>
