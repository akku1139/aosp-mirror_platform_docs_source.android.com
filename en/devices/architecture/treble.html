<p>The Android 8.0 release includes Project Treble, a major re-architect
of the Android OS framework designed to make it easier, faster, and less costly
for manufacturers to update devices to a new version of Android. Treble is for
all new devices launching with Android 8.0 and beyond (the new architecture is
already running on the Developer Preview for Pixel phones).</p>

<h2 id=about-treble>About Android updates</h2>
<p>Project Treble separates the vendor implementation (device-specific,
lower-level software written by silicon manufacturers) from the Android OS
framework via a new vendor interface.</p>

<p>In Android 7.x and earlier, no formal vendor interface exists so device
makers must update large portions of the Android code to move a device to a
newer version of Android:</p>

<p>With Treble, a new stable vendor interface provides access to the
hardware-specific parts of Android, enabling device makers to deliver new
Android releases simply by updating the Android OS framework&mdash;without any
additional work required from the silicon manufacturers:</p>

<h2 id=testing-treble>Testing Treble</h2>
<p>To ensure forward compatibility of vendor implementations, the new vendor
interface is validated by the <a href="/devices/tech/vts/index.html">Vendor Test
Suite (VTS)</a>, which is analogous to the
<a href="/compatibility/cts/">Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)</a>. You can use
VTS to automate HAL and OS kernel testing in both pre-Treble and Treble
environments.</p>

pronounced "hide-l"), which is an interface description language (IDL) to
specify the interface between a HAL and its users.</li>
