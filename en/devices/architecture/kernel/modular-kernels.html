<p>
  Android 8.0 introduced a modular kernel, splitting the device kernel into
  a system-on-chip (SoC), device, and board-specific deliverables. This change
  made it possible for original device manufacturers (ODMs) and original
  equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to work in isolated, board-specific trees for
  board-specific features and drivers, enabling them to override common kernel
  configurations, add new drivers in the form of kernel modules, etc.
</p>

<p>Modular kernel support in Android includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Platform support for independent SoC and OEM/ODM kernel development.
  Android {{ androidPVersionNumber }} and higher recommends building and
  shipping all board-specific code as kernel modules in devices. As a result:
  <ul>
    <li>All platforms should support either
    <a href="https://www.devicetree.org/" class="external">devicetree</a> or
    <a href="http://www.uefi.org/acpi/specs" class="external">Advanced
    Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</a> to describe all
    non-discoverable devices.</li>
    <li>All devicetree-based platforms should add board-specific device nodes
    to the kernel devicetree as
    <a href="/devices/architecture/dto/index">overlays</a>.</li>
   </ul></li>
  <li>Application binary interface (ABI)/application programming interface (API)
  tests in <a href="/devices/tech/vts/index">Vendor Test Suite (VTS)</a>. These
  tests ensure that a given kernel can run the Android Open Source Project
  (AOSP) framework.</li>
  <li>Minimum kernel version per Android release.</li>
  <li>Support for generating
  <a href="/devices/architecture/vintf/index">Android Vendor Interface (VINTF)
  kernel objects</a>.</li>
</ul>
