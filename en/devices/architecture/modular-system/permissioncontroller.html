<p>
  The PermissionController module enables updatable privacy policies and UI
  elements (for example, the policies and UI around granting and managing
  permissions). This module handles permission-related UI and logic (it was
  refactored from Package Installer) and roles (allow access for apps for a
  specific purpose).
</p>

<h2 id="permissioncontroller-q">Changes in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}
</h2>

<p>
  The <code>com.android.permissioncontroller</code> APK handles
  permission-related UI, logic, and roles to allow access for apps for a
  specific purpose. It controls the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Runtime permission granting (including granting to system apps)</li>
  <li>Runtime permission management (including grouping of permissions)</li>
  <li>Runtime permission usage tracking (new in Android
  {{ androidQVersionNumber }})</li>
  <li>Roles (new in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }})</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In Android 9, such permissions were part of
  <code>com.android.packageinstaller</code>. In Android
  {{ androidQVersionNumber }} and higher, the Package Installer app is
  split to enable the permissions logic to be updated.
</p>

<p>
  As an updatable Android module, PermissionController:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interacts with the framework only through stable <code>@SystemApi</code>
  APIs (no <code>@hide</code> API usage).</li>
  <li>Handles permission-related intents with priority greater than 0.</li>
  <li>Exposes a mechanism for enabling Android partners to customize theming.
  </li>
  <li>Provides services to which the system and apps can bind, including role
  management, permission revocation, and basic permission information (for
  Settings).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="permissioncontroller-format">Format and dependencies</h2>

<p>
  The PermissionController module is delivered as an APK file.
