<p>
  The Time Zone Data module updates daylight saving time (DST) and time zones on
  Android devices, standardizing both the data (which can change frequently in
  response to religious, political, and geopolitical reasons) and the update
  mechanism across the ecosystem. For more details on Time Zone Data, see
  <a href="/devices/tech/config/timezone-rules">Time Zone Rules</a>.

<h2 id="timezone-q">Changes in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}</h2>

<p>
  Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} deprecates the
  <a href="/devices/tech/config/timezone-rules">APK-based time zone data update
  mechanism</a> (used in Android 8.1 and Android 9) and replaces it with an
  <a href="/devices/tech/ota/apex">APEX-based module update mechanism</a>. AOSP
  continues to include the platform code necessary for APK-based updates, so
  devices upgrading to Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} can still receive
  partner-provided time zone data updates through APK. However, the APK update
  mechanism shouldn't be used on a production device that is also receiving
  module updates, as an APK-based update supersedes an APEX-based update (that
  is, a device that receives an APK update ignores APEX-based updates).
</p>

<h2 id="timezone-format">Format and dependencies</h2>

<p>
  The Time Zone Data module is distributed as an
  <a href="/devices/tech/ota/apex">APEX</a> file.
