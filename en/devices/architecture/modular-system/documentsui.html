<p>
  The DocumentsUI module controls access to specific files for components that
  handle document permissions (such as attaching a file to an email). Making
  storage access and permissions into an updatable module increases privacy and
  security for end users while allowing Android partners to customize the
  features and theming of the app through runtime resource overlays (RROs). The
  module format ensures that all devices ship with the same DocumentsUI
  experience, enabling developers to know what users see for associated APIs.

<h2 id="documentsui-q">Changes in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}</h2>

<p>
  In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the DocumentsUI module implements the
  <code>GET_CONTENT</code> action that enables apps to request access to other
  data from the user. As an updatable module, DocumentsUI:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interacts with the framework only through stable <code>@SystemApi</code>
  APIs (no <code>@hide</code> API usage).</li>
  <li>Exposes a mechanism for enabling Android partners to customize features
  and theming.</li>
  <li>Protects the <code>MANAGE_DOCUMENTS</code> permission using a signature
  permission.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="documentsui-format">Format and dependencies</h2>

<p>
  The DocumentsUI module is delivered as an APK file. It relies on the
  <code>MANAGE_DOCUMENTS</code> permission protected by the signature
  permission, and an additional permission class ensures that only one app on
  the device has the <code>MANAGE_DOCUMENTS</code> permission.
