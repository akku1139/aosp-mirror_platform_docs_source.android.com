<p>
  Media modules provide security updates and media feature updates without
  requiring a full system image update. Media components are a frequent target
  of attacks (many recent security bugs are media related), so tightening
  security by accelerating updates for security bugs and features should reduce
  the number of security bugs that can be exploited by attacks. The media
  framework remains extensible; partners can continue to extend media codecs
  and media format extractors.
