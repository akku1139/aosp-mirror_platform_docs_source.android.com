<p>HIDL requires every interface written in HIDL be versioned. After a HAL
interface is published, it is frozen and any further changes must be made to a
new version of that interface. While a given published interface may not be
modified, it can be extended by another interface.</p>

<h2 id=code-structure>HIDL code structure</h2>

<p>
<a href="/reference/hidl/index.html">HIDL code is organized</a> in user-defined
types, interfaces, and packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>User-defined types (UDTs)</strong>. HIDL provides access to a set of
primitive data types that can be used to compose more complex types via
structures, unions, and enumerations</a>. UDTs are passed to methods of
interfaces, and can be defined at the level of a package (common to all
interfaces) or locally to an interface.</li>
<li><strong>Interfaces</strong>. As a basic building block of HIDL, an interface
consists of UDT and method declarations. Interfaces can also inherit from
another interface.</li>
<li><strong>Packages</strong>. Organizes related HIDL interfaces and the data
types on which they operate. A package is identified by a name and a version and
includes the following:
<ul>
 <li>Data-type definition file called <code>types.hal</code>.</li>
 <li>Zero or more interfaces, each in their own <code>.hal</code> file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The data-type definition file <code>types.hal</code> contains only UDTs (all
package-level UDTs are kept in a single file). Representations in the target
language are available to all interfaces in the package.</p>

<h2 id=philosophy>Versioning philosophy</h2>
<p>A HIDL package (such as <code>android.hardware.nfc</code>), after being
published for a given version (such as <code>1.0</code>), is immutable; it
cannot be changed. Modifications to the interfaces in the package or any
changes to its UDTs can take place only in <em>another</em> package.</p>

<p>In HIDL, versioning applies at the package level, not at the interface level,
and all interfaces and UDTs in a package share the same version. Package
versions follow <a href="http://semver.org/" class="external">semantic
versioning</a> without the patch level and build-metadata components. Within a
given package, a <strong>minor version</strong> bump implies the new version of
the package is backwards-compatible with the old package and a <strong>major
version</strong> bump implies the new version of the package is not
backwards-compatible with the old package.</p>

<p>Conceptually, a package can relate to another package in one of several ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not at all</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Package-level backwards-compatible extensibility</strong>. This
occurs for new minor-version uprevs (next incremented revision) of a package;
the new package has the same name and major version as the old package, but a
higher minor version. Functionally, the new package is a superset of the old
package, meaning:
<ul>
  <li>Top-level interfaces of the parent package are present in the new package,
  though the interfaces may have new methods, new interface-local UDTs (the
  interface-level extension described below), and new UDTs in
  <code>types.hal</code>.</li>
  <li>New interfaces may also be added to the new package.</li>
  <li>All data types of the parent package are present in the new package and
  can be handled by the (possibly reimplemented) methods from the old package.
  </li>
  <li>New data types may also be added for use by either new methods of uprev'ed
  existing interfaces, or by new interfaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Interface-level backwards-compatible extensibility</strong>. The new
package can also extend the original package by consisting of logically separate
interfaces that simply provide additional functionality, and not the core one.
For this purpose, the following may be desirable:
<ul>
  <li>Interfaces in the new package need recourse to the data types of the old
  package.</li>
  <li>Interfaces in new package may extend interfaces of one or more old
  packages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extend the original backwards-incompatibility</strong>. This is a
major-version uprev of the package and there need not be any correlation between
the two. To the extent that there is, it can be expressed with a combination of
types from the older version of the package, and inheritance of a subset of
old-package interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=structuring>Structuring interfaces</h2>

<p>For a well structured interface, adding new types of functionality that
are not part of the original design should require a modification to the HIDL
interface. Conversely, if you can or expect to make a change on both sides of
the interface that introduces new functionality without changing the interface
itself, then the interface is not structured.</p>

<p>Treble supports separately-compiled vendor and system components in which the
<code>vendor.img</code> on a device and the <code>system.img</code> can be
compiled separately. All interactions between <code>vendor.img</code> and
<code>system.img</code> must be explicitly and thoroughly defined so they can
continue to work for many years. This includes many API surfaces, but a major
surface is the IPC mechanism HIDL uses for interprocess communication on the
<code>system.img</code>/<code>vendor.img</code> boundary.</p>

<h3 id="structuring-requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>All data passed through HIDL must be explicitly defined. To ensure an
implementation and client can continue to work together even when compiled
separately or developed on independently, data must adhere to the following
requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can be described in HIDL directly (using structs enums, etc.) with
semantic names and meaning.</li>
<li>Can be described by a public standard such as ISO/IEC 7816.</li>
<li>Can be described by a hardware standard or physical layout of hardware.</li>
<li>Can be opaque data (such as public keys, ids, etc.) if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>If opague data is used, it must be read only by one side of the HIDL
interface. For example, if <code>vendor.img</code> code gives a component on the
<code>system.img</code> a string message or <code>vec&lt;uint8_t&gt;</code>
data, that data cannot be parsed by the <code>system.img</code> itself; it can
only be passed back to <code>vendor.img</code> to interpret. <strong>When
passing a value from <code>vendor.img</code> to vendor code on
<code>system.img</code> or to another device, the format of the data and how it
is to be interpreted must be exactly described and is still part of the
interface</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="structuring-guidelines">Guidelines</h3>

<p>You should be able to write an implementation or client of a HAL using only
the .hal files (i.e. you should not need to look at the Android source or public
standards). We recommend specifying the exact required behavior. Statements such
as "an implementation may do A or B" encourage implementations to become
intertwined with the clients they are developed with.</p>

<h2 id=code-layout>HIDL code layout</h2>
<p>HIDL includes core and vendor packages.</p>

<p>Core HIDL interfaces are those specified by Google. The packages they belong
to start with <code>android.hardware.</code> and are named by subsystem,
potentially with nested levels of naming. For example, the NFC package is named
<code>android.hardware.nfc</code> and the camera package is
<code>android.hardware.camera</code>. In general, a core package has the name
<code>android.hardware.</code>[<code>name1</code>].[<code>name2</code>]&#8230;.
HIDL packages have a version in addition to their name. For example, the package
<code>android.hardware.camera</code> may be at version <code>3.4</code>; this is
important, as the version of a package affects its placement in the source tree.
</p>

<p>All core packages are placed under <code>hardware/interfaces/</code> in the
build system. The package
<code>android.hardware.</code>[<code>name1</code>].[<code>name2</code>]&#8230;
at version <code>$m.$n</code> is under
<code>hardware/interfaces/name1/name2/</code>â€¦<code>/$m.$n/</code>; package
<code>android.hardware.camera</code> version <code>3.4</code> is in directory
<code>hardware/interfaces/camera/3.4/.</code> A hard-coded mapping exists
between the package prefix <code>android.hardware.</code> and the path
<code>hardware/interfaces/</code>.</p>

<p>Non-core (vendor) packages are those produced by the SoC vendor or ODM. The
prefix for non-core packages is <code>vendor.$(VENDOR).hardware.</code> where
<code>$(VENDOR)</code>refers to an SoC vendor or OEM/ODM. This maps to the path
<code>vendor/$(VENDOR)/interfaces</code> in the tree (this mapping is also
hard-coded).</p>

<h2 id=fqn>Fully-qualified user-defined-type names</h2>
<p>In HIDL, every UDT has a fully-qualified name that consists of the UDT name,
the package name where the UDT is defined, and the package version. The
fully-qualified name is used only when instances of the type are declared and
not where the type itself is defined. For example, assume package
<code>android.hardware.nfc,</code> version <code>1.0</code> defines a struct
named <code>NfcData</code>. At the site of the declaration (whether in
<code>types.hal</code> or within an interface's declaration), the declaration
simply states:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
struct NfcData {
    vec&lt;uint8_t&gt; data;
};
</pre>

<p>When declaring an instance of this type (whether within a data structure or
as a method parameter), use the fully-qualified type name:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">android.hardware.nfc@1.0::NfcData</pre>

<p>The general syntax is
<code><var>PACKAGE</var>@<var>VERSION</var>::<var>UDT</var></code>, where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code><var>PACKAGE</var></code> is the dot-separated name of a HIDL package
(e.g., <code>android.hardware.nfc</code>).</li>
<li><code><var>VERSION</var></code> is the dot-separated major.minor-version
format of the package (e.g., <code>1.0</code>).</li>
<li><code><var>UDT</var></code> is the the dot-separated name of a HIDL UDT.
Since HIDL supports nested UDTs and HIDL interfaces can contain UDTs (a type of
nested declaration), dots are used to access the names.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if the following nested declaration was defined in the common
types file in package <code>android.hardware.example</code> version
<code>1.0</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// types.hal
package android.hardware.example@1.0;
struct Foo {
    struct Bar {
        // â€¦
    };
    Bar cheers;
};
</pre>

<p>The fully-qualified name for <code>Bar</code> is
<code>android.hardware.example@1.0::Foo.Bar</code>. If, in addition to being in
the above package, the nested declaration were in an interface called
<code>IQuux</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// IQuux.hal
package android.hardware.example@1.0;
interface IQuux {
    struct Foo {
        struct Bar {
            // â€¦
        };
        Bar cheers;
    };
    doSomething(Foo f) generates (Foo.Bar fb);
};
</pre>

<p>The fully-qualified name for <code>Bar</code> is
<code>android.hardware.example@1.0::IQuux.Foo.Bar</code>.</p>

<p>In both cases, <code>Bar</code> can be referred to as <code>Bar</code> only
within the scope of the declaration of <code>Foo</code>. At the package or
interface level, you must refer to <code>Bar</code> via <code>Foo</code>:
<code>Foo.Bar</code>, as in the declaration of method <code>doSomething</code>
above. Alternatively, you could declare the method more verbosely as:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// IQuux.hal
doSomething(android.hardware.example@1.0::IQuux.Foo f) generates (android.hardware.example@1.0::IQuux.Foo.Bar fb);
</pre>

<h2 id=enumeration>Fully-qualified enumeration values</h2>
<p>If a UDT is an enum type, then each value of the enum type has a
fully-qualified name that starts with the fully-qualified name of the enum type,
followed by a colon, then followed by the name of the enum value. For example,
assume package <code>android.hardware.nfc,</code> version <code>1.0</code>
defines an enum type <code>NfcStatus</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum NfcStatus {
    STATUS_OK,
    STATUS_FAILED
};
</pre>

<p>When referring to <code>STATUS_OK</code>, the fully qualified name is:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">android.hardware.nfc@1.0::NfcStatus:STATUS_OK</pre>

<p>The general syntax is
<code><var>PACKAGE</var>@<var>VERSION</var>::<var>UDT</var>:<var>VALUE</var></code>,
where:

<ul>
<li><code><var>PACKAGE</var>@<var>VERSION</var>::<var>UDT</var></code> is the
exact same fully qualified name for the enum type.</li>
<li><code><var>VALUE</var></code> is the value's name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=auto-interference>Auto-inference rules</h2>
<p>A fully-qualified UDT name does not need to be specified. A UDT name can
safely omit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package, e.g. <code>@1.0::IFoo.Type</code></li>
<li>Both package and version, e.g. <code>IFoo.Type</code></li>
</ul>

<aside class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> UDT names missing a version but
specifying a package present are not allowed.</aside>

<p>HIDL attempts to complete the name using auto-interference rules (lower rule
number means higher priority).</p>

<h3 id=rule1>Rule 1</h3>
<p>If no package and version is provided, a local name lookup is attempted.
Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
interface Nfc {
    typedef string NfcErrorMessage;
    send(NfcData d) generates (@1.0::NfcStatus s, NfcErrorMessage m);
};
</pre>

<p><code>NfcErrorMessage</code> is looked up locally, and the <code>typedef</code>
above it is found. <code>NfcData</code> is also looked up locally, but as it is
not defined locally, rule 2 and 3 are used. <code>@1.0::NfcStatus</code>
provides a version, so rule 1 does not apply.</p>

<h3 id=rule2>Rule 2</h3>
<p>If rule 1 fails and a component of the fully-qualified name is missing
(package, version, or package and version), the component is autofilled with
information from the current package. The HIDL compiler then looks in the
current file (and all imports) to find the autofilled fully-qualified name.
Using the example above, assume the declaration of <code>ExtendedNfcData</code>
was made in the same package (<code>android.hardware.nfc</code>) at the same
version (<code>1.0</code>) as <code>NfcData</code>, as follows:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
struct ExtendedNfcData {
    NfcData base;
    // â€¦ additional members
};
</pre>

<p>The HIDL compiler fills out the package name and version name from the
current package to produce the fully-qualified UDT name
<code>android.hardware.nfc@1.0::NfcData</code>. As the name exists in the
current package (assuming it is imported properly), it is used for the
declaration.</p>

<p>A name in the current package is imported only if one of the following is
true:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is imported explicitly with an <code>import</code> statement.</li>
<li>It is defined in <code>types.hal</code> in the current package</li>
</ul>

<p>The same process is followed if <code>NfcData</code> was qualified by only
the version number:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
struct ExtendedNfcData {
    // autofill the current package name (android.hardware.nfc)
    @1.0::NfcData base;
    // â€¦ additional members
};
</pre>

<h3 id=rule3>Rule 3</h3>
<p>If rule 2 fails to produce a match (the UDT is not defined in the current
package), the HIDL compiler scans for a match within all imported packages.
Using the above example, assume <code>ExtendedNfcData</code> is declared in
version <code>1.1</code> of package <code>android.hardware.nfc</code>,
<code>1.1</code> imports <code>1.0</code> as it should (see
<a href="#package-ext">Package-Level Extensions</a>), and the definition
specifies only the UDT name:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
struct ExtendedNfcData {
    NfcData base;
    // â€¦ additional members
};
</pre>

<p>The compiler looks for any UDT named <code>NfcData</code> and finds one in
<code>android.hardware.nfc</code> at version <code>1.0</code>, resulting in a
fully-qualified UDT of <code>android.hardware.nfc@1.0::NfcData</code>. If more
than one match is found for a given partially-qualified UDT, the HIDL compiler
throws an error.</p>

<h3 id=rule-example>Example</h3>
<p>Using rule 2, an imported type defined in the current package is favored over
an imported type from another package:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// hardware/interfaces/foo/1.0/types.hal
package android.hardware.foo@1.0;
struct S {};

// hardware/interfaces/foo/1.0/IFooCallback.hal
package android.hardware.foo@1.0;
interface IFooCallback {};

// hardware/interfaces/bar/1.0/types.hal
package android.hardware.bar@1.0;
typedef string S;

// hardware/interfaces/bar/1.0/IFooCallback.hal
package android.hardware.bar@1.0;
interface IFooCallback {};

// hardware/interfaces/bar/1.0/IBar.hal
package android.hardware.bar@1.0;
import android.hardware.foo@1.0;
interface IBar {
    baz1(S s); // android.hardware.bar@1.0::S
    baz2(IFooCallback s); // android.hardware.foo@1.0::IFooCallback
};
</pre>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>S</code></strong> is interpolated as
<code>android.hardware.bar@1.0::S</code>, and is found in
<code>bar/1.0/types.hal</code> (because <code>types.hal</code> is automatically
imported).</li>
<li><strong><code>IFooCallback</code></strong> is interpolated as
<code>android.hardware.bar@1.0::IFooCallback</code> using rule 2, but it
cannot be found because <code>bar/1.0/IFooCallback.hal</code> is not imported
automatically (as <code>types.hal</code> is). Thus, rule 3 resolves it to
<code>android.hardware.foo@1.0::IFooCallback</code> instead, which is imported
via <code>import android.hardware.foo@1.0;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=types>types.hal</h2>
<p>Every HIDL package contains a <code>types.hal</code> file containing UDTs
that are shared among all interfaces participating in that package. HIDL types
are always public; regardless of whether a UDT is declared in
<code>types.hal</code> or within an interface declaration, these types are
accessible outside of the scope where they are defined. <code>types.hal</code>
is not meant to describe the public API of a package, but rather to host UDTs
used by all interfaces within the package. Due to the nature of HIDL, all UDTs
are a part of the interface.</p>

<p><code>types.hal</code> consists of UDTs and <code>import</code> statements.
Because <code>types.hal</code> is made available to every interface of the
package (it is an implicit import), these <code>import</code> statements are
package-level by definition. UDTs in <code>types.hal</code> may also incorporate
UDTs and interfaces thus imported.</p>

<p>For example, for an <code>IFoo.hal</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
package android.hardware.foo@1.0;
// whole package import
import android.hardware.bar@1.0;
// types only import
import android.hardware.baz@1.0::types;
// partial imports
import android.hardware.qux@1.0::IQux.Quux;
// partial imports
import android.hardware.quuz@1.0::Quuz;
</pre>

<p>The following are imported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>android.hidl.base@1.0::IBase</code> (implicitly)</li>
<li><code>android.hardware.foo@1.0::types</code> (implicitly)</li>
<li>Everything in <code>android.hardware.bar@1.0</code> (including all
interfaces and its <code>types.hal</code>)</li>
<li><code>types.hal</code> from <code>android.hardware.baz@1.0::types</code>
(interfaces in <code>android.hardware.baz@1.0</code> are not imported)</li>
<li><code>IQux.hal</code> and <code>types.hal</code> from
<code>android.hardware.qux@1.0</code></li>
<li><code>Quuz</code> from <code>android.hardware.quuz@1.0</code> (assuming
<code>Quuz</code> is defined in <code>types.hal</code>, the entire
<code>types.hal</code> file is parsed, but types other than <code>Quuz</code>
are not imported).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=interface-version>Interface-level versioning</h2>
<p>Each interface within a package resides in its own file. The package the
interface belongs to is declared at the top of the interface using the
<code>package</code> statement. Following the package declaration, zero or more
interface-level imports (partial or whole-package) may be listed. For example:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">package android.hardware.nfc@1.0;</pre>

<p>In HIDL, interfaces can inherit from other interfaces using the
<code>extends</code> keyword. For an interface to extend another interface, it
must have access to it via an <code>import</code> statement. The name of the
interface being extended (the base interface) follows the rules for type-name
qualification explained above. An interface may inherit only from one interface;
HIDL does not support multiple inheritance.</p>

<p>The uprev versioning examples below use the following package:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// types.hal
package android.hardware.example@1.0
struct Foo {
    struct Bar {
        vec&lt;uint32_t&gt; val;
    };
};

// IQuux.hal
package android.hardware.example@1.0
interface IQuux {
    fromFooToBar(Foo f) generates (Foo.Bar b);
}
</pre>

<h3 id=rules>Uprev rules</h3>
<p>To define a package <code>package@major.minor</code>, either A or all of B
must be true:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th width="10%">Rule A</th>
<td>"Is a start minor version": All previous minor versions,
<code>package@major.0</code>, <code>package@major.1</code>, &#8230;,
<code>package@major.(minor-1)</code> must not be defined.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<strong>OR</strong>

<table>
<tr>
<th width="10%">Rule B</th>
<td><p>All of the following is true:</p>

<ol>
<li>"Previous minor version is valid": <code>package@major.(minor-1)</code>
must be defined and follow the same rule A (none of
<code>package@major.0</code> through <code>package@major.(minor-2)</code>
are defined) or rule B (if it is an uprev from <code>@major.(minor-2)</code>);
<br><br>
AND
<br><br>
</li>
<li>"Inherit at least one interface with the same name": There exists an
interface <code>package@major.minor::IFoo</code> that extends
<code>package@major.(minor-1)::IFoo</code> (if the previous package has an interface);
<br><br>
AND
<br><br>
</li>
<li>"No inherited interface with a different name": There must not exist
<code>package@major.minor::IBar</code> that extends
<code>package@major.(minor-1)::IBaz</code>, where <code>IBar</code> and
<code>IBaz</code> are two different names. If there is an interface with the
same name, <code>package@major.minor::IBar</code> must extend
<code>package@major.(minor-k)::IBar</code> such that no IBar exists with a
smaller k.</li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Because of rule A:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package can start with any minor version number (for example,
<code>android.hardware.biometrics.fingerprint</code> starts at
<code>@2.1</code>.)</li>
<li>The requirement "<code>android.hardware.foo@1.0</code> is not defined" means
the directory <code>hardware/interfaces/foo/1.0</code> should not even exist.
</li>
</ul>

<p>However, rule A does not affect a package with the same package name but a
different <em>major</em> version (for example,
<code>android.hardware.camera.device</code> has both <code>@1.0</code> and
<code>@3.2</code> defined; <code>@3.2</code> doesn't need to interact with
<code>@1.0</code>.) Hence, <code>@3.2::IExtFoo</code> can extend
<code>@1.0::IFoo</code>.</p>

<p>Provided the package name is different,
<code>package@major.minor::IBar</code> may extend from an interface with a
different name (for example, <code>android.hardware.bar@1.0::IBar</code> can
extend <code>android.hardware.baz@2.2::IBaz</code>). If an interface does not
explicitly declare a super type with the <code>extend</code> keyword, it will
extend <code>android.hidl.base@1.0::IBase</code> (except <code>IBase</code>
itself).</p>

<p>B.2 and B.3 must be followed at the same time. For example, even if
<code>android.hardware.foo@1.1::IFoo</code> extends
<code>android.hardware.foo@1.0::IFoo</code> to pass rule B.2, if an
<code>android.hardware.foo@1.1::IExtBar</code> extends
<code>android.hardware.foo@1.0::IBar</code>, this is still not a valid uprev.
</p>

<h3 id=uprev>Upreving interfaces</h3>
<p>To uprev <code>android.hardware.example@1.0</code> (defined above) to
<code>@1.1</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// types.hal
package android.hardware.example@1.1;
<strong>import android.hardware.example@1.0;</strong>

// IQuux.hal
package android.hardware.example@1.1
interface IQuux <strong>extends @1.0::IQuux</strong> {
    <strong>fromBarToFoo(Foo.Bar b) generates (Foo f);</strong>
}
</pre>

<p>This is a package-level <code>import</code> of version <code>1.0</code> of
<code>android.hardware.example</code> in <code>types.hal</code>. While no new
UDTs are added in version <code>1.1</code> of the package, references to UDTs in
version <code>1.0</code> are still needed, hence the package-level import
in <code>types.hal</code>. (The same effect could have been achieved with an
interface-level import in <code>IQuux.hal</code>.)</p>

<p>In <code>extends @1.0::IQuux</code> in the declaration of
<code>IQuux</code>, we specified the version of <code>IQuux</code> that is being
inherited (disambiguation is required because <code>IQuux</code> is used to
declare an interface and to inherit from an interface). As declarations are
simply names that inherit all package and version attributes at the site of the
declaration, the disambiguation must be in the name of the base interface; we
could have used the fully-qualified UDT as well, but that would have been
redundant.</p>

<p>The new interface <code>IQuux</code> does not re-declare method
<code>fromFooToBar()</code> it inherits from <code>@1.0::IQuux</code>; it simply
lists the new method it adds <code>fromBarToFoo()</code>. In HIDL, inherited
methods may <strong>not</strong> be declared again in the child interfaces, so
the <code>IQuux</code> interface cannot declare the <code>fromFooToBar()</code>
method explicitly.</p>

<aside class="key-point"><strong>Key Point:</strong> In HIDL, every inherited
method from a base class must be explicitly implemented in the inheriting class.
If a method implementation needs to fall back to the method implementation of
the base class, the fallback must be in the implementation.</aside>

<h3 id=conventions>Uprev conventions</h3>
<p>Sometimes interface names must rename the extending interface. We recommend
that enum extensions, structs, and unions have the same name as what they extend
unless they are sufficiently different to warrant a new name. Examples:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// in parent hal file
enum Brightness : uint32_t { NONE, WHITE };

// in child hal file extending the existing set with additional similar values
enum Brightness : @1.0::Brightness { AUTOMATIC };

// extending the existing set with values that require a new, more descriptive name:
enum Color : @1.0::Brightness { HW_GREEN, RAINBOW };
</pre>

<p>Unless a method warrants a new name, it should be named similarly to what it
is extending. For example, the method <code>foo_1_1</code> in
<code>@1.1::IFoo</code> may replace the functionality of the <code>foo</code>
method in <code>@1.0::IFoo</code>.</p>

<h2 id=package-ext>Package-level versioning</h2>
<p>HIDL versioning occurs at the package level; after a package is published, it
is immutable (its set of interfaces and UDTs cannot be changed). Packages can
relate to each other in several ways, all of which are expressible via a
combination of interface-level inheritance and building of UDTs by composition.
</p>

<p>However, one type of relationship is strictly-defined and must be enforced:
<em>Package-level backwards-compatible inheritance</em>. In this scenario, the
<em>parent</em> package is the package being inherited from and the
<em>child</em> package is the one extending the parent. Package-level
backwards-compatible inheritance rules are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>All top-level interfaces of the parent package are inherited from by interfaces in the
child package.</li>
<li>New interfaces may also be added the new package (no restrictions about
relationships to other interfaces in other packages).</li>
<li>New data types may also be added for use by either new methods of uprev'ed
existing interfaces, or by new interfaces.</li>
</ol>

<p>These rules can be implemented using HIDL interface-level inheritance and UDT
composition, but require meta-level knowledge to know these relationships
constitute a backwards-compatible package extension. This knowledge is inferred
as follows:</p>

<aside class="key-point"><strong>Key Point:</strong> For package
<code>package</code> at version <code>major.minor</code>, if a
<code>package</code> exists at <code>major.(minor-1)</code>, then
<code>package@major.minor</code> is a minor uprev, and must follow the rules for
backwards-compatibility.</aside>

<p>If a package meets this requirement, <code>hidl-gen</code> enforces
backwards-compatibility rules.</p>
