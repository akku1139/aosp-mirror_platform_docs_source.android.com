<p>This document describes HIDL interface hashing, a mechanism to prevent
accidental interface changes and ensure interface changes are thoroughly vetted.
This mechanism is required because HIDL interfaces are versioned, which means
that after an interface is released it must not be changed except in an
Application Binary Interface (ABI) preserving manner (such as a comment
correction).</p>

<h2 id=layout>Layout</h2>
<p>Every package root directory (i.e. <code>android.hardware</code> mapping to
<code>hardware/interfaces</code> or <code>vendor.foo</code> mapping to
<code>vendor/foo/hardware/interfaces</code>) must contain a
<code>current.txt</code> file that lists all released HIDL interface files.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
# current.txt files support comments starting with a ‘#' character
# this file, for instance, would be vendor/foo/hardware/interfaces/current.txt

# Each line has a SHA-256 hash followed by the name of an interface.
# They have been shortened in this doc for brevity but they are
# 64 characters in length in an actual current.txt file.
d4ed2f0e...995f9ec4 vendor.awesome.foo@1.0::IFoo # comments can also go here

# types.hal files are also noted in types.hal files
c84da9f5...f8ea2648 vendor.awesome.foo@1.0::types

# Multiple hashes can be in the file for the same interface. This can be used
# to note how ABI sustaining changes were made to the interface.
# For instance, here is another hash for IFoo:

# Fixes type where "FooCallback" was misspelled in comment on "FooStruct"
822998d7...74d63b8c vendor.awesome.foo@1.0::IFoo
</pre>

<p class=note><strong>Note:</strong> To help keep track of which hashes come
from where, Google separates HIDL <code>current.txt</code> files into different
sections: The first section is <em>Released in Android O</em>; the next section
will be <em>Released in Android O MR1</em>. We strongly recommend using a
similar layout in your <code>current.txt</code> file.</p>

<h2 id=hidl-gen>Hashing with hidl-gen</h2>
<p>You can add a hash to a <code>current.txt</code> file manually or by
using <code>hidl-gen</code>. The following code snippet provides examples of
commands you can use with <code>hidl-gen</code> to manage a
<code>current.txt</code> file (hashes have been shortened):</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">hidl-gen -L hash -r vendor.awesome:vendor/awesome/hardware/interfaces -r android.hardware:hardware/interfaces -r android.hidl:system/libhidl/transport vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0::types</code>
9626fd18...f9d298a6 vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0::types
<code class="devsite-terminal">hidl-gen -L hash -r vendor.awesome:vendor/awesome/hardware/interfaces -r android.hardware:hardware/interfaces -r android.hidl:system/libhidl/transport vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0::INfc</code>
07ac2dc9...11e3cf57 vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0::INfc
<code class="devsite-terminal">hidl-gen -L hash -r vendor.awesome:vendor/awesome/hardware/interfaces -r android.hardware:hardware/interfaces -r android.hidl:system/libhidl/transport vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0</code>
9626fd18...f9d298a6 vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0::types
07ac2dc9...11e3cf57 vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0::INfc
f2fe5442...72655de6 vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0::INfcClientCallback
<code class="devsite-terminal">hidl-gen -L hash -r vendor.awesome:vendor/awesome/hardware/interfaces -r android.hardware:hardware/interfaces -r android.hidl:system/libhidl/transport vendor.awesome.nfc@1.0 &gt;&gt; vendor/awesome/hardware/interfaces/current.txt</code>
</pre>

<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not replace a hash for a
previously-released interface. When changing such an interface, add a new hash
to the end of the <code>current.txt</code> file. For details, refer to
<a href="#abi-stability">ABI stability</a>.</p>

<p>Every interface definition library generated by <code>hidl-gen</code>
includes hashes, which can be retrieved by calling
<code>IBase::getHashChain</code>. When <code>hidl-gen</code> is compiling an
interface, it checks the <code>current.txt</code> file in the root directory of
the HAL package to see if the HAL has been changed:</p>

<ul>
<li>If no hash for the HAL is found, the interface is considered unreleased (in
development) and compilation proceeds.</li>
<li>If hashes are found, they are checked against the current interface:
<ul>
<li>If the interface does match the hash, compilation proceeds.</li>
<li>If the interface does not match a hash, compilation is halted as this means a previously-released interface is being changed.
<ul>
<li>For an ABI-preserving change (see
<a href="#abi-stability">ABI stability</a>), the <code>current.txt</code> file
must be modified before compilation can proceed.</li>
<li>All other changes should be made in a minor or major version upgrade of the
interface.</li>
</ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<h2 id=abi-stability>ABI stability</h2>
<aside class="key-point"><strong>Key Point:</strong> Please read and understand
this section carefully.</aside>

<p>An Application Binary Interface (ABI) includes the binary
linkages/calling conventions/etc. If the ABI/API changes, the interface no
longer works with a generic <code>system.img</code> that was compiled with
official interfaces.</p>

<p>Making sure that interfaces are versioned and ABI stable is
<strong>crucial</strong> for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It ensures your implementation can pass the Vendor Test Suite (VTS), which
puts you on track to being able to do framework-only OTAs.</li>
<li>As an OEM, it enables you to provide a Board Support Package (BSP) that is
straightforward to use and compliant.</li>
<li>It helps you keep track of what interfaces can be released. Consider
<code>current.txt</code> a map of an interfaces directory that allows you to see
the history and state of all interfaces being provided in a package root.</li>
</ul>

<p>When adding a new hash for an interface that already has an entry in
<code>current.txt</code>, make sure to add only the hashes that represent
interfaces which maintain ABI stability. Review the following types of changes:
</p>

<table>
<tbody>

<tr>
<th>Changes allowed</th>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Changing a comment (unless this changes the meaning of a method).</li>
<li>Changing the name of a parameter.</li>
<li>Changing the name of a return parameter.</li>
<li>Changing annotations.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Changes not allowed</th>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Reordering arguments, methods, etc…</li>
<li>Adding a method/struct field/etc… anywhere in the interface.</li>
<li>Anything that would break a C++ vtable.</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
