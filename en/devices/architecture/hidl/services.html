<p>This section describes how to register and discover services and how to send
data to a service by calling methods defined in interfaces in <code>.hal</code>
files.</p>

<h2 id=register>Registering services</h2>
<p>HIDL interface servers (objects implementing the interface) can be registered
as named services. The registered name need not be related to the interface or
package name. If no name is specified, the name "default" is used; this should
be used for HALs that do not need to register two implementations of the same
interface. For example, the C++ call for service registration defined in each
interface is:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
status_t status = myFoo->registerAsService();
status_t anotherStatus = anotherFoo->registerAsService("another_foo_service");  // if needed
</pre>

<p>The version of a HIDL interface is included in the interface itself. It is
automatically associated with service registration and can be retrieved via a
method call (<code>android::hardware::IInterface::getInterfaceVersion()</code>)
on every HIDL interface. Server objects need not be registered and can be passed
via HIDL method parameters to another process that will make HIDL method calls
into the server.</p>

<h2 id=discover>Discovering services</h2>
<p>Requests by client code are made for a given interface by name and by
version, calling <code>getService</code> on the desired HAL class:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
// C++
sp&lt;V1_1::IFooService&gt; service = V1_1::IFooService::getService();
sp&lt;V1_1::IFooService&gt; alternateService = V1_1::IFooService::getService("another_foo_service");
// Java
V1_1.IFooService service = V1_1.IFooService.getService(true /* retry */);
V1_1.IFooService alternateService = V1_1.IFooService.getService("another", true /* retry */);
</pre>

<p>Each version of a HIDL interface is treated as a separate interface. Thus,
<code>IFooService</code> version 1.1 and <code>IFooService</code> version 2.2
can both be registered as "foo_service" and
<code>getService("foo_service")</code> on either interface gets the registered
service for that interface. This is why, in most cases, no name parameter needs
to be supplied for registration or discovery (meaning name "default").</p>

<p>The Vendor Interface Object also plays a part in the transport method of the
returned interface. For an interface <code>IFoo</code> in package
<code>android.hardware.foo@1.0</code>, the returned interface by
<code>IFoo::getService</code> always use the transport method declared for
<code>android.hardware.foo</code> in the device manifest if the entry exists;
and if the transport method is not available, nullptr is returned.</p>

<p> In some cases, it may be necessary to continue immediately even without
getting the service. This can happen (for instance) when a client wants to
manage service notifications itself or in a diagnostic program (such as
<code>atrace</code>) which needs to get all hwservices and retrieve them. In
this case, additional APIs are provided such as <code>tryGetService</code> in C++ or
<code>getService("instance-name", false)</code> in Java. The legacy API
<code>getService</code> provided in Java also must be used with service
notifications. Using this API does not avoid the race condition where a server
registers itself after the client requests it with one of these no-retry APIs.</p>

<h2 id=death>Service death notifications</h2>
<p>Clients who want to be notified when a service dies can receive death
notifications delivered by the framework. To receive notifications, the client
must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subclass the HIDL class/interface <code>hidl_death_recipient</code> (in C++
code, not in HIDL).</li>
<li>Override its <code>serviceDied()</code> method.</li>
<li>Instantiate an object of the <code>hidl_death_recipient</code> subclass.
</li>
<li>Call the <code>linkToDeath()</code> method on the service to monitor,
passing in the <code>IDeathRecipient</code>'s interface object. Note that this
method does not take ownership of the death recipient or the proxy on which it
is called.</li>
</ol>

<p>A pseudocode example (C++ and Java are similar):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class IMyDeathReceiver : hidl_death_recipient {
  virtual void serviceDied(uint64_t cookie,
                           wp&lt;IBase&gt;&amp; service) override {
    log("RIP service %d!", cookie);  // Cookie should be 42
  }
};
....
IMyDeathReceiver deathReceiver = new IMyDeathReceiver();
m_importantService-&gt;linkToDeath(deathReceiver, 42);
</pre>

<p>The same death recipient may be registered on multiple different services.
</p>

<h2 id=data-transwer>Data transfer</h2>
<p>Data may be sent to a service by calling methods defined in interfaces in
<code>.hal</code> files. There are two kinds of methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blocking</strong> methods wait until the server has produced a
result.</li>
<li><strong>Oneway</strong> methods send data in only one direction and do not
block. If the amount of data in-flight in RPC calls exceeds implementation
limits, the calls may either block or return an error indication (behavior is
not yet determined).</li>
</ul>

<p>A method that does not return a value but is not declared as
<code>oneway</code> is still blocking.</p>

<p>All methods declared in a HIDL interface are called in a single direction,
either from the HAL or into the HAL. The interface does not specify which
direction it will be called in. Architectures that need calls to originate from
the HAL should provide two (or more) interfaces in the HAL package and serve the
appropriate interface from each process. The words <em>client</em> and
<em>server</em> are used with respect to the calling direction of the interface
(i.e. the HAL can be a server of one interface and a client of another
interface).</p>

<h3 id=callbacks>Callbacks</h3>
<p>The word <em>callback</em> refers to two different concepts, distinguished by
<em>synchronous callback</em> and <em>asynchronous callback</em>.</p>

<p><em>Synchronous callbacks</em> are used in some HIDL methods that return
data. A HIDL method that returns more than one value (or returns one value of
non-primitive type) returns its results via a callback function. If only one
value is returned and it is a primitive type, a callback is not used and the
value is returned from the method. The server implements the HIDL methods and
the client implements the callbacks.</p>

<p><em>Asynchronous callbacks</em> allow the server of a HIDL interface to
originate calls. This is done by passing an instance of a second interface
through the first interface. The client of the first interface must act as the
server of the second. The server of the first interface can call methods on the
second interface object. For example, a HAL implementation may send information
asynchronously back to the process that is using it by calling methods on an
interface object created and served by that process. Methods in interfaces used
for asynchronous callback may be blocking (and may return values to the caller)
or <code>oneway</code>. For an example, see "Asynchronous callbacks" in
<a href="/devices/architecture/hidl-cpp/interfaces.html">HIDL C++</a>.</p>

<p>To simplify memory ownership, method calls and callbacks take only
<code>in</code> parameters and do not support <code>out</code> or
<code>inout</code> parameters.</p>

<h3 id=limits>Per-transaction limits</h3>
<p>Per-transaction limits may be imposed on the amount of data sent in HIDL
methods and callbacks. The limits are yet to be determined but may be as small
as 4K. Calls exceeding these limits return failure immediately. Another
limitation is the resources available to the HIDL infrastructure to handle
multiple simultaneous transactions. Multiple transactions can be in-flight
simultaneously due to multiple threads or processes sending calls to a process
or multiple <code>oneway</code> calls that are not handled quickly by the
receiving process.</p>

<p>In a well-designed interface, exceeding these resource limitations should not
happen; if it does, the call which exceeded them may either block until
resources become available or signal a transport error. Each occurrence of
exceeding per-transaction limits or overflowing HIDL implementation resources by
aggregate in-flight transactions is logged to facilitate debugging.</p>

<h3 id=method-implement>Method implementations</h3>
<p>HIDL generates header files declaring the necessary types, methods, and
callbacks in the target language (C++ or Java). The prototype of HIDL-defined
methods and callbacks is the same for both client and server code. The HIDL
system provides <strong>proxy</strong> implementations of the methods on the
caller side that organize the data for IPC transport, and <strong>stub</strong>
code on the callee side that passes the data into developer implementations of
the methods.</p>

<p>The caller of a function (HIDL method or callback) has ownership of the data
structures passed into the function, and retains ownership after the call; in
all cases the callee does not need to free or release the storage.</p>

<ul>
<li>In C++, the data may be read-only (attempts to write to it may cause a
segmentation fault) and are valid for the duration of the call. The client can
deep-copy the data to propagate it beyond the call.</li>
<li>In Java, the code receives a local copy of the data (a normal Java object),
which it may keep and modify or allow to be garbage-collected.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=non-rpc>Non-RPC data transfer</h3>
<p>HIDL has two ways to transfer data without using an RPC call: shared
memory and a Fast Message Queue (FMQ), both supported only in C++.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shared memory</strong>. The built-in HIDL type <code>memory</code>
is used to pass an object representing shared memory that has been allocated.
Can be used in a receiving process to map the shared memory.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Message Queue (FMQ)</strong>. HIDL provides a templated message
queue type that implements no-wait message-passing. It does not use the kernel
or scheduler in passthrough or binderized mode (inter-device communication will
not have these properties). Typically, the HAL sets up its end of the queue,
creating an object that can be passed through RPC via a parameter of built-in
HIDL type <code>MQDescriptorSync</code> or <code>MQDescriptorUnsync</code>. This
object can be used by the receiving process to set up the other end of the queue.
<ul>
<li><em>Sync</em> queues are not allowed to overflow, and can only have one
reader.</li>
<li><em>Unsync</em> queues are allowed to overflow, and can have many readers,
each of which must read data in time or lose it.</li>
</ul>
Neither type is allowed to underflow (read from an empty queue will fail), and
each type can only have one writer.</li></ul>
