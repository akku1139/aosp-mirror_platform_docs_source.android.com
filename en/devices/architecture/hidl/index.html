<p>HAL interface definition language or HIDL (pronounced "hide-l") is an
interface description language (IDL) to specify the interface between a HAL and
its users. It allows specifying types and method calls, collected into
interfaces and packages. More broadly, HIDL is a system for communicating
between codebases that may be compiled independently.</p>

<p>HIDL is intended to be used for inter-process communication (IPC).
Communication between processes is referred to as
<a href="/devices/architecture/hidl/binder-ipc"><em>Binderized</em></a>. For
libraries that must be linked to a process, a <a href="#passthrough">passthrough
mode</a> is also available (not supported in Java).</p>

<p>HIDL specifies data structures and method signatures, organized in interfaces
(similar to a class) that are collected into packages. The syntax of HIDL will
look familiar to C++ and Java programmers, though with a different set of
keywords. HIDL also uses Java-style annotations.</p>

<h2 id=design>HIDL design</h2>
<p>The goal of HIDL is that the framework can be replaced without having to
rebuild HALs. HALs will be built by vendors or SOC makers and put in a
<code>/vendor</code> partition on the device, enabling the framework, in its own
partition, to be replaced with an OTA without recompiling the HALs.</p>

<p>HIDL design balances the following concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>. Create reliably interoperable interfaces
between processes which may be compiled with various architectures, toolchains,
and build configurations. HIDL interfaces are versioned and cannot be changed
after they are published.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>. HIDL tries to minimize the number of copy
operations. HIDL-defined data is delivered to C++ code in C++ standard layout
data structures that can be used without unpacking. HIDL also provides shared
memory interfaces and, as RPCs are inherently somewhat slow, HIDL supports two
ways to transfer data without using an RPC call: shared memory and a Fast
Message Queue (FMQ).</li>
<li><strong>Intuitive</strong>. HIDL avoids thorny issues of memory ownership by
using only <code>in</code> parameters for RPC (see
<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html" class="external">Android
Interface Definition Language (AIDL)</a>); values that cannot be efficiently
returned from methods are returned via callback functions. Neither passing data
into HIDL for transfer nor receiving data from HIDL changes the ownership of the
data&mdash;ownership always remains with the calling function. Data needs to
persist only for the duration of the called function and may be destroyed
immediately after the called function returns.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=passthrough>Using passthrough mode</h2>
<p>To update devices running earlier versions of Android to Android O, you can
wrap both conventional (and legacy) HALs in a new HIDL interface that serves the
HAL in binderized and same-process (passthrough) modes. This wrapping is
transparent to both the HAL and the Android framework.</p>

<p>Passthrough mode is available only for C++ clients and implementations.
Devices running earlier versions of Android do not have HALs written in Java, so
Java HALs are inherently binderized.</p>

<h3 id=header>Passthrough header files</h3>
<p>When a <code>.hal</code> file is compiled, <code>hidl-gen</code> produces an
extra passthrough header file <code>BsFoo.h</code> in addition to the headers
used for binder communication; this header defines functions to be
<code>dlopen</code>ed. As passthrough HALs run in the same process in which
they are called, in most cases passthrough methods are invoked by direct
function call (same thread). <code>oneway</code> methods run in their own thread
as they are not intended to wait for the HAL to process them (this means any HAL
that uses <code>oneway</code> methods in passthrough mode must be thread-safe).
</p>

<p>Given an <code>IFoo.hal</code>, <code>BsFoo.h</code> wraps the HIDL-generated
methods to provide additional features (such as making <code>oneway</code>
transactions run in another thread). This file is similar to
<code>BpFoo.h</code>, however instead of passing on calls IPC using binder, the
desired functions are directly invoked. Future implementations of HALs
<strong>may provide</strong> multiple implementations, such as FooFast HAL and a
FooAccurate HAL. In such cases, a file for each additional implementation would
be created (e.g., <code>PTFooFast.cpp</code> and
<code>PTFooAccurate.cpp</code>).</p>

<h3 id=binderized>Binderizing passthrough HALs</h3>
<p>You can binderize HAL implementations that support passthrough mode. Given a
HAL interface <code>a.b.c.d@M.N::IFoo</code>, two packages are created:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>a.b.c.d@M.N::IFoo-impl</code>. Contains the implementation of the HAL
and exposes function <code>IFoo* HIDL_FETCH_IFoo(const char* name)</code>. On
legacy devices, this package is <code>dlopen</code>ed and the implementation is
instantiated using <code>HIDL_FETCH_IFoo</code>. You can generate the base code
using <code>hidl-gen</code> and <code>-Lc++-impl</code> and
<code>-Landroidbp-impl</code>.</li>
<li><code>a.b.c.d@M.N::IFoo-service</code>. Opens the passthrough HAL and
registers itself as a binderized service, enabling the same HAL implementation
to be used as both passthrough and binderized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the type <code>IFoo</code>, you can call <code>sp&lt;IFoo&gt;
IFoo::getService(string name, bool getStub)</code> to get access to an instance
of <code>IFoo</code>. If <code>getStub</code> is true, <code>getService</code>
attempts to open the HAL only in passthrough mode. If <code>getStub</code> is
false, <code>getService</code> attempts to find a binderized service; if that
fails, it then tries to find the passthrough service. The <code>getStub</code>
parameter should never be used except in
<code>defaultPassthroughServiceImplementation</code>. (Devices launching with
Android O are fully binderized devices, so opening a service in passthrough mode
is disallowed.)</p>

<h2 id=grammar>HIDL grammar</h2>
<p>By design, the HIDL language is similar to C (but does not use the C
preprocessor). All punctuation not described below (aside from the obvious use
of <code>=</code> and <code>|</code>) is part of the grammar.</p>

<p class=note><strong>Note:</strong> For details on HIDL code style, see the
<a href="code-style.html">Code Style Guide</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/** */</code> indicates a documentation comment. These can be applied
only to type, method, field, and enum value declarations.</li>
<li><code>/* */</code> indicates a multiline comment.</li>
<li><code>//</code> indicates a comment to end of line. Aside from
<code>//</code>, newlines are the same as any other whitespace. </li>
<li>In the example grammar below, text from <code>//</code> to the end of the
line is not part of the grammar but is instead a comment on the grammar.</li>
<li><code>[empty]</code> means that the term may be empty. </li>
<li><code>?</code> following a literal or term means it is optional.</li>
<li><code>...</code> indicates sequence containing zero or more items with
separating punctuation as indicated. There are no variadic arguments in HIDL.</li>
<li>Commas separate sequence elements.</li>
<li>Semicolons terminate each element, including the last element.</li>
<li>UPPERCASE is a nonterminal.</li>
<li><code><em>italics</code></em> is a token family such as
<code><em>integer</code></em> or <code><em>identifier</code></em> (standard C
parsing rules).</li>
<li><code><em>constexpr</em> </code>is a C style constant expression (such as
<code>1 + 1</code> and <code>1L &lt;&lt; 3</code>).</li>
<li><code><em>import_name</code></em> is a package or interface name, qualified
as described in <a href="/devices/architecture/hidl/versioning.html"> HIDL
Versioning</a>.</li>
<li>Lowercase <code>words</code> are literal tokens.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=terms>Terminology</h2>
<p>This section uses the following HIDL-related terms:</p>

<table>
<tbody>

<tr>
<th>binderized</th>
<td>Indicates HIDL is being used for remote procedure calls between processes,
implemented over a Binder-like mechanism. See also <em>passthrough</em>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>callback, asynchronous</th>
<td>Interface served by a HAL user, passed to the HAL (via a HIDL method), and
called by the HAL to return data at any time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>callback, synchronous</th>
<td>Returns data from a server's HIDL method implementation to the client.
Unused for methods that return void or a single primitive value.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>client</th>
<td>Process that calls methods of a particular interface. A HAL or framework
process may be a client of one interface and a server of another. See also
<em>passthrough</em>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>extends</th>
<td>Indicates an interface that adds methods and/or types to another interface.
An interface can extend only one other interface. Can be used for a minor
version increment in the same package name or for a new package (e.g. a vendor
extension) to build on an older package.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>generates</th>
<td>Indicates an interface method that returns values to the client. To return
one non-primitive value, or more than one value, a synchronous callback function
is generated.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>interface</th>
<td>Collection of methods and types. Translated into a class in C++ or Java. All
methods in an interface are called in the same direction: a client process
invokes methods implemented by a server process.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>oneway</th>
<td>When applied to a HIDL method, indicates the method returns no values and
does not block.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>package</th>
<td>Collection of interfaces and data types sharing a version.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>passthrough</th>
<td>Mode of HIDL in which the server is a shared library, <code>dlopen</code>ed
by the client. In passthrough mode, client and server are the same process but
separate codebases. Used only to bring legacy codebases into the HIDL model.
See also <em>Binderized</em>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>server</th>
<td>Process that implements methods of an interface. See also
<em>passthrough</em>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>transport</th>
<td>HIDL infrastructure that moves data between the server and client.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>version</th>
<td>Version of a package. Consists of two integers, major and minor. Minor
version increments may add (but not change) types and methods.</td>
</tr>
