<p>Given a HIDL interface file, the Java HIDL backend generates Java interfaces,
Stub, and Proxy code. It supports all scalar HIDL types
([<code>u</code>]<code>int</code>{<code>8,16,32,64}_t, float, double,</code> and
<code>enum</code>s), as well as strings, interfaces, safe_union types, struct
types, and arrays and vectors of supported HIDL types. The Java HIDL backend
<strong>does NOT support union types, native handles, shared memory, and fmq
types</strong>.</p>

<p>As Java runtime does not support the concept of unsigned integers natively,
all unsigned types (and enums based on them) are silently treated as their
signed equivalents, i.e. <code>uint32_t</code> becomes an <code>int</code> in
the Java interface. No value conversion is performed; the implementor on the
Java side must use the signed values as if they were unsigned.</p>

<h2 id=enum>Enums</h2>
<p>Enums do not generate Java enum classes but are instead translated into inner
classes containing a static constant definition for each enum case. If the enum
class derives from some other enum class, it inherits that class's storage type.
Enumerations based on an unsigned integer type are rewritten into their signed
equivalent. Since the underlying type is a primitive, the default value for
enum fields/variables is zero even when there is no zero enumerator.</p>

<p>For example, a <code>SomeBaseEnum</code> with a type of
<code>uint8_t</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum SomeBaseEnum : uint8_t { foo = 3 };
enum SomeEnum : SomeBaseEnum {
    quux = 33,
    goober = 127
};
</pre>

<p>… becomes:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
public final class SomeBaseEnum { public static final byte foo = 3; }
public final class SomeEnum {
    public static final byte foo = 3;
    public static final byte quux = 33;
    public static final byte goober = 127;
}
</pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum SomeEnum : uint8_t {
    FIRST_CASE = 10,
    SECOND_CASE = 192
};
</pre>

<p>… is rewritten as:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
public final class SomeEnum {
    static public final byte FIRST_CASE  = 10;  // no change
    static public final byte SECOND_CASE = -64;
}
</pre>

<h2 id=string>Strings</h2>
<p><code>String</code>s in Java are utf-8 or utf-16 but are converted to utf-8
as the common HIDL type when transported. Additionally, a <code>String</code>
must not be null when passed into HIDL.</p>

<h2 id=array-vect>Arrays and vectors</h2>
<p>Arrays are translated into Java arrays and vectors are translated into
<code>ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</code> where T is the appropriate object type, possibly
wrapping scalar types such as <code>vec&lt;int32_t&gt; =&gt;
ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</code>). For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
takeAnArray(int32_t[3] array);
returnAVector() generates (vec&lt;int32_t&gt; result);
</pre>

<p>… becomes:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
void takeAnArray(int[] array);
ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; returnAVector();
</pre>

<h2 id=struct>Structures</h2>
<p>Structures are translated into Java classes with a similar layout. For
example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
struct Bar {
 vec&lt;bool&gt; someBools;
};
struct Foo {
 int32_t a;
 int8_t b;
 float[10] c;
 Bar d;
};
</pre>

<p>… becomes:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Bar {
 public final ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt; someBools = new ArrayList();
};
class Foo {
 public int a;
 public byte b;
 public final float[] c = new float[10];
 public final Bar d = new Bar();
}
</pre>

<h2 id=declared>Declared types</h2>
<p>Each top-level type declared in <code>types.hal</code> gets its own .java
output file (as required by Java). For example, the following
<code>types.hal</code> file results in two extra files being created (Foo.java
and Bar.java):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
struct Foo {
 ...
};

struct Bar {
 ...

 struct Baz {
 };

 ...
};
</pre>

<p>The definition of Baz lives in a static inner class of Bar (in Bar.java).</p>
