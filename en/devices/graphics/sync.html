<p>The synchronization framework explicitly describes dependencies between
different asynchronous operations in the Android graphics system. The framework
provides an API that enables components to indicate when buffers are released. The framework also
allows synchronization primitives to be passed between drivers from the kernel
to userspace and between userspace processes themselves.</p>

<p>For example, an application may queue up work to be performed in the GPU.
The GPU starts drawing that image. Although the image hasn’t been drawn
into memory yet, the buffer pointer is passed to the window
compositor along with a fence that indicates when the GPU work will
finish. The window compositor starts processing ahead of time and
passes the work to the display controller. In a similar manner, the CPU work
is done ahead of time. Once the GPU finishes, the display controller
immediately displays the image.</p>

<p>The synchronization framework also lets implementers leverage
synchronization resources in their own hardware components. Finally, the
framework provides visibility into the graphics pipeline to help with
debugging.</p>


<h2 id="explicit_synchronization">Explicit synchronization</h2>

<p>Explicit synchronization enables producers and consumers of graphics buffers
to signal when they're finshied using a buffer. Explicit synchronization is
implemented in kernel-space.</p>

<p>The benefits of explicit synchronization include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less behavior variation between devices</li>
  <li>Better debugging support</li>
  <li>Improved testing metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>The sync framework has three object types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sync_timeline</code></li>
  <li><code>sync_pt</code></li>
  <li><code>sync_fence</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sync_timeline">sync_timeline</h3>

<p><code>sync_timeline</code> is a monotonically increasing timeline that
vendors should implement for each driver instance, such as a GL context,
display controller, or 2D blitter. <code>sync_timeline</code> counts
jobs submitted to the kernel for a particular piece of hardware.
<code>sync_timeline</code> provides guarantees about the order of operations
and enables hardware-specific implementations.</p>

<p>One implementation of <code>sync_timeline</code> is offered as a CPU-only
reference called <code>sw_sync</code> (software sync). If a vendor doesn't have
a hardware-backed sync object resource, <code>sw_sync</code>
should be used to save resources and avoid complexity.</p>

<p>Follow these guidelines when implementing <code>sync_timeline</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide useful names for all drivers, timelines, and fences to simplify
  debugging.</li>
<li>Implement the <code>timeline_value_str</code> and <code>pt_value_str</code>
  operators in timelines to make debugging output more readable.</li>
<li>Implement the fill <code>driver_data</code> to give userspace libraries,
  such as the GL library, access to private timeline data, if desired.
  <code>data_driver</code> lets vendors pass information about the immutable
  <code>sync_fence</code> and <code>sync_pts</code> to build command lines
  based on them.</li>
<li>Don't allow userspace to explicitly create or signal a fence. Explicitly
  creating signals/fences results in a denial-of-service attack that
  halts pipeline functionality.</li>
<li>Don't access <code>sync_timeline</code>, <code>sync_pt</code>, or
  <code>sync_fence</code> elements explicitly. The API provides all required
  functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sync_pt">sync_pt</h3>

<p><code>sync_pt</code> is a single value or point on a
<code>sync_timeline</code>. A point
has three states: active, signaled, and error. Points start in the active state
and transition to the signaled or error states. For example, when an image
consumer no longer needs a buffer, a <code>sync_pt</code> is signaled
so an image producer knows that it's okay to write into the buffer again.</p>

<h3 id="sync_fence">sync_fence</h3>

<p><code>sync_fence</code> is a collection of <code>sync_pt</code> values
that often
have different <code>sync_timeline</code> parents (such as for the display
controller and GPU). <code>sync_fence</code>, <code>sync_pt</code>, and
<code>sync_timeline</code> are the main primitives that drivers and userspace
use to communicate their dependencies. When a fence becomes signaled, all
commands issued before the fence are guaranteed to be complete because the
kernel driver or hardware block executes commands in order.</p>

<p>The sync framework allows multiple consumers or producers to signal when they're
using a buffer, communicating the dependency information with one function
parameter. Fences are backed by a file descriptor and are passed from
kernel space to userspace. For example, a fence can contain two
<code>sync_pt</code> values that signify when two separate image consumers are done
reading a buffer. When the fence is signaled, the image producers know that both
consumers are done consuming.</p>

<p>Fences, like <code>sync_pt</code> values, start active and change state based on
the state of their points. If all <code>sync_pt</code> values become signaled, the
<code>sync_fence</code> becomes signaled. If one <code>sync_pt</code> falls
into an error state, the entire <code>sync_fence</code> has an error state.</p>

<p>Membership in a <code>sync_fence</code> is immutable after the fence is
created. To get more than one point in a fence, a merge is
conducted where points from two distinct fences are added to a third fence.
If one of those points was signaled in the originating fence and the other wasn't,
the third fence also won't be in a signaled state.</p>

<p>To implement explicit synchronization, provide the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A kernel-space subsystem that implements the sync framework
for a particular hardware driver. Drivers that need to be fence-aware are
generally anything that accesses or communicates with the Hardware Composer.
Key files include:
<ul>
<li>Core implementation:
<ul>
 <li><code>kernel/common/include/linux/sync.h</code></li>
 <li><code>kernel/common/drivers/base/sync.c</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>sw_sync</code>:
<ul>
 <li><code>kernel/common/include/linux/sw_sync.h</code></li>
 <li><code>kernel/common/drivers/base/sw_sync.c</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Documentation at <code>kernel/common/Documentation/sync.txt</code></li>
<li>Library to communicate with the kernel space in
 <code>platform/system/core/libsync</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The vendor must provide the appropriate synchronization
fences as parameters to the <code>validateDisplay()</code> and
<code>presentDisplay()</code> functions in the HAL.</li>
<li>Two fence-related GL extensions (<code>EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync</code>
and <code>EGL_ANDROID_wait_sync</code>) and fence support in graphics
driver.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="case-study">Case study: Implementing a display driver</h3>

<p>To use the API supporting the synchronization function,
develop a display driver that has a display buffer function. Before the
synchronization framework existed, this function would receive <code>dma-buf</code>
objects, put those buffers on the display, and block while the buffer was visible. For
example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
/*
 * assumes buffer is ready to be displayed.  returns when buffer is no longer on
 * screen.
 */
void display_buffer(struct dma_buf *buffer);
</pre>

<p>With the synchronization framework, the <code>display_buffer</code> function
is more complex. While putting a buffer on display, the buffer is associated
with a fence that indicates when the buffer will be ready. You can queue up
and initiate the work after the fence clears.</p>

<p>Queuing and initiating work after the fence clears doesn't block anything.
You immediately return your own fence, which guarantees when the buffer
will be off of the display. As you queue up buffers, the kernel lists
dependencies with the synchronization framework:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
/*
 * displays buffer when fence is signaled.  returns immediately with a fence
 * that signals when buffer is no longer displayed.
 */
struct sync_fence* display_buffer(struct dma_buf *buffer, struct sync_fence
*fence);
</pre>


<h2 id="sync_integration">Sync integration</h2>

<p>This section explains how to integrate the kernel-space sync framework with
userspace parts of the Android framework and the drivers that must communicate
with one another. Kernel-space objects are represented as file descriptors in
userspace.</p>

<h3 id="integration_conventions">Integration conventions</h3>

<p>Follow the Android HAL interface conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the API provides a file descriptor that refers to a <code>sync_pt</code>,
  the vendor's driver or the HAL using the API must close the file descriptor.</li>
<li>If the vendor driver or the HAL passes a file descriptor that contains
 a <code>sync_pt</code> to an API function, the vendor driver or the HAL must not
  close the file descriptor.</li>
<li>To continue using the fence file descriptor, the vendor driver or the
  HAL must duplicate the descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>A fence object is renamed every time it passes through BufferQueue.
Kernel fence support allows fences to have strings for names, so the sync
framework uses the window name and buffer index that's being queued to name
the fence, such as <code>SurfaceView:0</code>. This
is helpful in debugging to identify the source of a deadlock as the names appear
in the output of <code>/d/sync</code> and bug reports.</p>

<h3 id="anativewindow_integration">ANativeWindow integration</h3>

<p>ANativeWindow is fence aware. <code>dequeueBuffer</code>,
<code>queueBuffer</code>, and <code>cancelBuffer</code> have fence parameters.
</p>

<h3 id="opengl_es_integration">OpenGL ES integration</h3>

<p>OpenGL ES sync integration relies on two EGL extensions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync</code> provides a way to
  wrap or create native Android fence file descriptors in
  <code>EGLSyncKHR</code> objects.</li>
<li><code>EGL_ANDROID_wait_sync</code> allows GPU-side stalls
rather than CPU-side, making the GPU wait for <code>EGLSyncKHR</code>. The
<code>EGL_ANDROID_wait_sync</code> extension is the same as the
<a
href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/KHR/EGL_KHR_wait_sync.txt"
class="external"><code>EGL_KHR_wait_sync</code></a> extension.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use these extensions independently, implement the
<code>EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync</code> extension along with the associated
kernel support. Next, enable the <code>EGL_ANDROID_wait_sync</code>
extension in your driver. The <code>EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync</code>
extension consists of a distinct native fence <code>EGLSyncKHR</code> object
type. As a result, extensions that apply to existing <code>EGLSyncKHR</code>
object types don’t necessarily apply to <code>EGL_ANDROID_native_fence</code>
objects, avoiding unwanted interactions.</p>

<p>The <code>EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync</code> extension employs a corresponding native
fence file descriptor attribute that can be set only at creation time and
can't be directly queried onward from an existing sync object. This attribute
can be set to one of two modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A valid fence file descriptor</strong> wraps an existing native
Android fence file descriptor in an <code>EGLSyncKHR</code> object.</li>
<li><strong>-1</strong> creates a native Android fence file descriptor from an
  <code>EGLSyncKHR</code> object.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the <code>DupNativeFenceFD()</code> function call to extract the
<code>EGLSyncKHR</code> object from the native Android fence file descriptor.
This has the same result as querying the set attribute, but adheres to
the convention that the recipient closes the fence (hence the duplicate
operation). Finally, destroying the <code>EGLSyncKHR</code> object closes
the internal fence attribute.</p>

<h3 id="hardware_composer_integration">Hardware Composer integration</h3>

<p>The Hardware Composer handles three types of sync fences:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Acquire fences</strong> are passed along with input buffers to
    the <code>setLayerBuffer</code> and <code>setClientTarget</code> calls.
    These represent a pending write into the buffer and must signal before the
    SurfaceFlinger or the HWC attempts to read from the associated buffer to
    perform composition.</li>
<li><strong>Release fences</strong> are retrieved after the call to
  <code>presentDisplay</code> using the <code>getReleaseFences</code> call.
  These represent a pending read from the previous buffer on the same layer. A
  release fence signals when the HWC is no longer using the previous buffer
  because the current buffer has replaced the previous buffer on the display.
  Release fences are passed back to the app along with the previous buffers that
  will be replaced during the current composition. The app must wait until a
  release fence signals before writing new contents into the buffer that
  was returned to them.</li>
<li><strong>Present fences</strong> are returned, one per frame, as part of
  the call to <code>presentDisplay</code>. Present fences represent when the
  composition of this frame has completed, or alternately, when the
  composition result of the prior frame is no longer needed. For physical
  displays, <code>presentDisplay</code> returns present fences when the
  current frame appears on the screen. After present fences are returned,
  it's safe to write to the SurfaceFlinger target buffer again, if
  applicable. For virtual displays, present fences are returned when it's
  safe to read from the output buffer.</li>
</ul>
