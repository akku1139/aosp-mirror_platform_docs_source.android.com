<p>Review the following information to test graphics implementations.</p>

<p>For benchmarking, use the following flow by phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Specification.</em> When initially specifying the device (such as when
  using immature drivers), use predefined (fixed) clocks and workloads to
  measure frames per second (fps) rendered. This gives a clear view of hardware
  capabilities.</li>
  <li><em>Development.</em> As drivers mature, use a fixed set of user actions
  to measure the number of visible stutters (janks) in animations.</li>
  <li><em>Production.</em> When a device is ready for comparison against
  competitors, increase the workload until stutters increase. Determine if the
  current clock settings can keep up with the load. This can help you identify
  where to slow the clocks and reduce power use.</li>
</ul>

<p>For help deriving device capabilities during the specification phase, use the
Flatland tool at <code>platform/frameworks/native/cmds/flatland/</code>.
Flatland relies on fixed clocks and shows the throughput achievable with
composition-based workloads. It uses gralloc buffers to simulate multiple window
scenarios, filling in the window with GL then measuring the compositing.</p>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Flatland uses the synchronization
framework to measure time, so your implementation must support the
synchronization framework.</aside>
