<p>Android supports
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/" class="external">Vulkan</a>, a
low-overhead, cross-platform API for high-performance 3D graphics. Like OpenGL
ES (GLES), Vulkan provides tools for creating high-quality, real-time graphics
in apps. Advantages of using Vulkan include reductions in CPU overhead and
support for the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/spir" class="external">SPIR-V
Binary Intermediate</a> language.</p>

<p>System on chip vendors (SoCs) such as GPU independent hardware vendors (IHVs)
can write Vulkan drivers for Android. OEMs need to integrate these
drivers for specific devices. For details on how a Vulkan driver interacts with
the system, how GPU-specific tools should be installed, and Android-specific
requirements, see <a href="/devices/graphics/implement-vulkan">Implementing
Vulkan.</a></p>

<p>Application developers use Vulkan to create apps that
execute commands on the GPU with significantly reduced overhead. Vulkan also
provides a more direct mapping to the capabilities found in current graphics
hardware compared to EGL and GLES, minimizing opportunities for driver bugs and
reducing developer testing time.</p>

<p>For general information on Vulkan, refer to the
<a href="http://khr.io/vulkanlaunchoverview" class="external">Vulkan
Overview</a> or see the list of <a href="#resources">Resources</a>.</p>

<h2 id="vulkan_components">Vulkan components</h2>
<p>Vulkan support includes the following components.</p>
<p><img src="/devices/graphics/images/ape_graphics_vulkan.png" alt="Vulkan

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Vulkan components</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Component name</th>
    <th>Provider</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan Validation Layers</td>
    <td>Android (in the NDK)</td>
    <td>Libraries used during the development of Vulkan apps to find errors in
      an app's use of the Vulkan API. After API usage errors are found, these
      libraries should be removed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vulkan Runtime</td>
    <td>Android</td>
    <td>A native library, <code>libvulkan.so</code>, that provides a native
      Vulkan API.<br/><br/>

       Most of Vulkan Runtime's functionality is implemented by a driver
       provided by the GPU vendor. Vulkan Runtime wraps the driver, provides API
       interception capabilities (for debugging and other developer tools), and
       manages the interaction between the driver and the platform
       dependencies.</td>

    <td>Vulkan Driver</td>
    <td>SoC</td>
    <td>Maps the Vulkan API onto hardware-specific GPU commands and interactions
      with the kernel graphics driver.</td>

<h2 id="modified_components">Modified components</h2>
<p>BufferQueue and Gralloc support Vulkan:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>BufferQueue.</strong> Additional enum values and methods in
  BufferQueue and the <code>ANativeWindow</code> interface enable Vulkan
  Runtime to connect to BufferQueue through <code>ANativeWindow</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Gralloc.</strong> An optional interface lets Gralloc
  discover whether a given format can be used for a particular
  producer/consumer combination without allocating a buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details on these components, see
<a href="/devices/graphics/arch-bq-gralloc">BufferQueue and
gralloc</a>. For details on <code>ANativeWindow</code>, see
<a href="/devices/graphics/arch-egl-opengl">EGLSurfaces and OpenGL
ES</a>).
