<p>Android has evolved over time to support a wide variety of storage device
types and features. All versions of Android support devices with <a href=
"/devices/storage/traditional.html">traditional storage</a>, which includes
portable and emulated storage. <em>Portable</em> storage can be provided by
physical media, like an SD card or USB, that is for temporary data transfer/
file storage. The physical media may remain with the device for an extended
period of time, but is not tied to the device and may be removed. SD cards have
been available as portable storage since Android 1.0; Android 6.0 added USB
support. <em>Emulated</em> storage is provided by exposing a portion of
internal storage through an emulation layer and has been available since
Android 3.0.</p>

<p>Starting in Android 6.0, Android supports <a href=
"/devices/storage/adoptable.html"><em>adoptable</em> storage</a>, which is
provided by physical media, like an SD card or USB, that is encrypted and
formatted to behave like internal storage. Adoptable storage can store all
types of application data.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">Permissions</h2>

<p>Access to external storage is protected by various Android permissions.
Starting in Android 1.0, write access is protected with the
<code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission. Starting in Android 4.1, read
access is protected with the <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission.</p>
<p>Starting in Android 4.4, the owner, group and modes of files on external
storage devices are now synthesized based on directory structure. This enables
apps to manage their package-specific directories on external storage without
requiring they hold the broad <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission.
For example, the app with package name <code>com.example.foo</code> can now
freely access <code>Android/data/com.example.foo/</code> on external storage
devices with no permissions. These synthesized permissions are accomplished by
wrapping raw storage devices in a FUSE daemon.</p>

<p>Starting in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, apps that target Android 9
and lower default to legacy storage, and can <em>opt in</em> to isolated storage.
Apps that target Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} and default to isolated
storage can <em>temporarily opt out</em> of it. Use the manifest attribute
<code><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#requestLegacyExternalStorage" class="external">requestLegacyExternalStorage</a></code>,
which controls the storage model, to change the default state.</p>

<p>Since both <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> and
<code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permissions are
soft-restricted, if the installer didn’t whitelist the app, the
permission controls access to the aural and visual collections
only, with no access to the SD card. This applies even if the app
requests legacy storage. For more information about both hard
restrictions and soft restrictions, see <a href=
"/devices/tech/config/runtime_perms#hardRestrictions">
Hard and soft restrictions in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}</a>.</p>

<p>If the installer whitelisted the permission, an app running in legacy mode
gets the nonisolated permission behavior. The permission controls SD card access, and the aural
and visual collections. This happens when either the app targets Android 9 or
lower and doesn’t opt in to isolated storage, or it targets Android {{
androidQVersionNumber }} and opts out.</p>

<p>The whitelist state can be specified only at install time, and
can't be changed until the app has been installed.</p>

<p>For more information on setting the <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>
permission, see <code><a href= "https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageInstaller.SessionParams#setWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions(java.util.Set%3Cjava.lang.String%3E)" class="external">
setWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions()</a></code> in the <a href=
"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageInstaller.SessionParams" class="external">
PackageInstaller.SessionParams</a> class.</p>

<h3 id="runtime_permissions">Runtime permissions</h3>

<p>Android 6.0 introduces a new <a href=
"/devices/tech/config/runtime_perms.html">runtime permissions</a> model where
apps request capabilities when needed at runtime. Because the new model
includes the <code>READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permissions, the platform
needs to dynamically grant storage access without killing or restarting
already-running apps. It does this by maintaining three distinct views of all
mounted storage devices:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/mnt/runtime/default</code> is shown to apps with no special storage
permissions, and to the root namespace where <code>adbd</code> and other system
components live.</li>
<li><code>/mnt/runtime/read</code> is shown to apps with
<code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> (Set <code>LEGACY_STORAGE</code> for Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }})</li>
<li><code>/mnt/runtime/write</code> is shown to apps with
<code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code></li>
</ul>

<p>At Zygote fork time, we create a mount namespace for each running app and
bind mount the appropriate initial view into place. Later, when runtime
permissions are granted, <code>vold</code> jumps into the mount namespace of
already-running apps and bind mounts the upgraded view into place. Note that
permission downgrades always result in the app being killed.</p>

<p>The <code>setns()</code> functionality used to implement this feature
requires at least Linux 3.8, but patches have been backported successfully to
Linux 3.4. The <code>PermissionsHostTest</code> CTS test can be used to verify
correct kernel behavior.</p>
