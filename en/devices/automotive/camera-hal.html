<p>Android 8.0 includes an automotive HIDL Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that
provides for imagery capture and display very early in the Android boot process
and continues functioning for the life of the system. The HAL includes the
exterior view system (EVS) stack and is typically used to support rear-view
camera and surround view displays in vehicles with Android-based In-Vehicle
Infotainment (IVI) systems. EVS also enables advanced features to be implemented
in user applications.</p>

<p>Android 8.0 also includes an EVS-specific capture and display driver
interface (in <code>/hardware/interfaces/automotive/evs/1.0</code>). While it is
possible to build a rear view camera application on top of existing Android
camera and display services, such an application would likely run too late in
the Android boot process. Using a dedicated HAL enables a streamlined interface
and makes it clear what an OEM needs to implement to support the EVS stack.</p>

<h2 id="system-components">System components</h2>
<p>EVS includes the following system components:</p>

<img src="/devices/automotive/images/vhal_evs_components.png" alt="EVS System
components diagram.">
<figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> EVS System components
overview.</figcaption>

<h3 id="evs-application-component">EVS application</h3>
<p>A sample C++ EVS application
(<code>/packages/services/Car/evs/app</code>) serves as a reference
implementation. This application is responsible for requesting video frames from
the EVS Manager and sending finished frames for display back to the EVS Manager.
It expects to be started by init as soon as EVS and Car Service are available,
targeted within two (2) seconds of power on. OEMs can modify or replace the EVS
application as desired.</p>

<h3 id="evs-manager-component">EVS Manager</h3>

<p>The EVS Manager (<code>/packages/services/Car/evs/manager</code>) provides
the building blocks needed by an EVS application to implement anything from a
simple rear view camera display to a 6DOF multi-camera rendering. Its interface
is presented through HIDL and is built to accept multiple concurrent clients.
Other applications and services (specifically the Car Service) can query the EVS
Manager state to find out when the EVS system is active.</p>

<h3 id="evs-hidl-interface">EVS HIDL interface</h3>

<p>The EVS system, both the camera and the display elements, is defined in the
<code>android.hardware.automotive.evs</code> package. A sample implementation
that exercises the interface (generates synthetic test images and validates the
images make the round trip) is provided in
<code>/hardware/interfaces/automotive/evs/1.0/default</code>.</p>

<p>The OEM is responsible for implementing the API expressed by the .hal files
in <code>/hardware/interfaces/automotive/evs</code>. Such implementations are
responsible for configuring and gathering data from physical cameras and
delivering it via shared memory buffers recognizable by Gralloc. The display
side of the implementation is responsible for providing a shared memory buffer
that can be filled by the application (usually via EGL rendering) and presenting
the finished frames in preference to anything else that might want to appear on
the physical display. Vendor implementations of the EVS interface may be stored
under <code>/vendor/… /device/…</code> or <code>hardware/…</code> (e.g.,
<code>/hardware/[vendor]/[platform]/evs</code>).</p>

<h3 id="kernel-drivers">Kernel drivers</h3>

<p>A device that supports the EVS stack requires kernel drivers. Instead of
creating new drivers, OEMs have the option to support EVS-required features via
existing camera and/or display hardware drivers. Reusing drivers could be
advantageous, especially for display drivers where image presentation may
require coordination with other active threads. Android 8.0 includes a v4l2-based
sample driver (in <code>packages/services/Car/evs/sampleDriver</code>) that
depends on the kernel for v4l2 support and on SurfaceFlinger for presenting the
output image.</p>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The dependency on SurfaceFlinger is
not appropriate for an actual vendor implementation as EVS must be able to run
within seconds of power on, long before SurfaceFlinger itself has booted.
However, the sample driver implementation is moderately hardware independent and
allows for EVS application development and testing in parallel with EVS driver
development.</aside>

<h2 id="evs-hardware-interface-description">EVS hardware interface
description</h2>

<p>The section describes the HAL. Vendors are expected to provide
implementations of this API adapted for their hardware.</p>

<h3 id="ievsenumerator-hw">IEvsEnumerator</h3>

<p>This object is responsible for enumerating the available EVS hardware in the
system (one or more cameras and the single display device).</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
getCameraList() generates (vec&lt;CameraDesc&gt; cameras);
</pre>

<p>Returns a vector containing descriptions for all cameras in the system. It is
assumed the set of cameras is fixed and knowable at boot time. For details on
camera descriptions, see <code><a href="#cameradesc">CameraDesc</a></code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
openCamera(string camera_id) generates (IEvsCamera camera);
</pre>

<p>Obtains an interface object used to interact with a specific camera
identified by the unique <em>camera_id</em> string. Returns a NULL on failure.
Attempts to reopen a camera that is already open cannot fail. To avoid race
conditions associated with application startup and shutdown, reopening a camera
should shut down the previous instance so the new request can be fulfilled. A
camera instance that has been preempted in this way must be put in an inactive
state, awaiting final destruction and responding to any request to affect the
camera state with a return code of <code>OWNERSHIP_LOST</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
closeCamera(IEvsCamera camera);
</pre>

<p>Releases the IEvsCamera interface (and is the opposite of the
<code>openCamera()</code> call). The camera video stream must be
  stopped by calling <code>stopVideoStream()</code> before calling <code>closeCamera</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
openDisplay() generates (IEvsDisplay display);
</pre>

<p>Obtains an interface object used to exclusively interact with the system's
EVS display. Only one client may hold a functional instance of IEvsDisplay at
time. Similar to the aggressive open behavior described in
<code>openCamera</code>, a new IEvsDisplay object may be created at any time and
will disable any previous instances. Invalidated instances continue to exist and
respond to function calls from their owners, but must perform no mutating
operations when dead. Eventually, the client application is expected to notice
the <code>OWNERSHIP_LOST</code> error return codes and close and release the
dead interface.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
closeDisplay(IEvsDisplay display);
</pre>

<p>Releases the IEvsDisplay interface (and is the opposite of the
<code>openDisplay()</code> call). Outstanding buffers received via
<code>getTargetBuffer()</code> calls must be returned to the display before
closing the display.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
getDisplayState() generates (DisplayState state);
</pre>

<p>Gets the current display state. The HAL implementation should report the
actual current state, which might differ from the most recently requested state.
The logic responsible for changing display states should exist above the device
layer, making it undesirable for the HAL implementation to spontaneously change
display states. If the display is not currently held by any client (by a call to
openDisplay), then this function returns <code>NOT_OPEN</code>. Otherwise, it
reports the current state of the EVS Display (see
<a href="#ievsdisplay-hw">IEvsDisplay API</a>).</p>

<a name="cameradesc"></a>
<pre class="prettyprint">
struct CameraDesc {
    string      camera_id;
    int32       vendor_flags;       // Opaque value
}
</pre>

<ul>
<li><code>camera_id</code>. A string that uniquely identifies a given camera.
Can be the kernel device name of the device or a name for the device, such as
<em>rearview</em>. The value for this string is chosen by the HAL implementation
and used opaquely by the stack above.</li>
<li><code>vendor_flags</code>. A method for passing specialized camera
information opaquely from the driver to a custom EVS application. It is passed
uninterpreted from the driver up to the EVS application, which is free to ignore
it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ievscamera-hw">IEvsCamera</h3>

<p>This object represents a single camera and is the primary interface for
capturing images.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
getCameraInfo() generates (CameraDesc info);
</pre>

<p>Returns <code>CameraDesc</code> of this camera.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
setMaxFramesInFlight(int32 bufferCount) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Specifies the depth of the buffer chain the camera is asked to support. Up to
this many frames may be held concurrently by the client of IEvsCamera. If this
many frames have been delivered to the receiver without being returned by
<code>doneWithFrame</code>, the stream skips frames until a buffer is returned
for reuse. It is legal for this call to come at any time, even while streams are
already running, in which case buffers should be added or removed from the chain
as appropriate. If no call is made to this entry point, the IEvsCamera supports
at least one frame by default; with more acceptable.</p>

<p>If the requested bufferCount cannot be accommodated, the function returns
<code>BUFFER_NOT_AVAILABLE</code> or other relevant error code. In this case,
the system continues to operate with the previously-set value.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
startVideoStream(IEvsCameraStream receiver) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Requests delivery of EVS camera frames from this camera. The IEvsCameraStream
begins receiving periodic calls with new image frames until
<code>stopVideoStream()</code> is called. Frames must begin being delivered
within 500ms of the <code>startVideoStream</code> call and after starting, must
generated at a minimum of 10 FPS. The time required to start the video stream
effectively counts against any rear view camera startup time requirement. If the
stream is not started, an error code must be returned; otherwise OK is returned.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
oneway doneWithFrame(BufferDesc buffer);
</pre>

<p>Returns a frame that was delivered by to the IEvsCameraStream. When done
consuming a frame delivered to the IEvsCameraStream interface, the frame must be
returned to the IEvsCamera for reuse. A small, finite number of buffers are
available (possibly as small as one), and if the supply is exhausted, no further
frames are delivered until a buffer is returned, potentially resulting in
skipped frames (a buffer with a null handle denotes the end of a stream and does
not need to be returned through this function). Returns OK on success, or
appropriate error code potentially including <code>INVALID_ARG</code> or
<code>BUFFER_NOT_AVAILABLE</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
stopVideoStream();
</pre>

<p>Stops the delivery of EVS camera frames. Because delivery is asynchronous,
frames may continue to arrive for some time after this call returns. Each frame
must be returned until the closure of the stream is signaled to the
IEvsCameraStream. It is legal to call <code>stopVideoStream</code> on a stream
that has already been stopped or never started, in which cases it is ignored.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
getExtendedInfo(int32 opaqueIdentifier) generates (int32 value);
</pre>

<p>Requests driver-specific information from the HAL implementation. Values
allowed for <code>opaqueIdentifier</code> are driver-specific, but no value
passed may crash the driver. The driver should return 0 for any unrecognized
<code>opaqueIdentifier</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
setExtendedInfo(int32 opaqueIdentifier, int32 opaqueValue) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Sends a driver-specific value to the HAL implementation. This extension is
provided only to facilitate vehicle-specific extensions and no HAL
implementation should require this call to function in a default state. If the
driver recognizes and accepts the values, OK should be returned; otherwise
<code>INVALID_ARG</code> or other representative error code should be returned.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
struct BufferDesc {
    uint32  width;      // Units of pixels
    uint32  height;     // Units of pixels
    uint32  stride;     // Units of pixels
    uint32  pixelSize;  // Size of single pixel in bytes
    uint32  format;     // May contain values from android_pixel_format_t
    uint32  usage;      // May contain values from Gralloc.h
    uint32  bufferId;   // Opaque value
    handle  memHandle;  // gralloc memory buffer handle
}
</pre>

<p>Describes an image passed through the API. The HAL drive is responsible for
filling out this structure to describe the image buffer and the HAL client
should treat this structure as read-only. The fields contain enough information
to allow the client to reconstruct an <code>ANativeWindowBuffer</code> object,
as may be required to use the image with EGL via the
<code>eglCreateImageKHR()</code> extension.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>width</code>. The width in pixels of the presented image.</li>
<li><code>height</code>. The height in pixels of the presented image.</li>
<li><code>stride</code>. Number of pixels each row actually occupies in memory,
accounting for any padding for alignment of rows. Expressed in pixels to match
the convention adopted by gralloc for its buffer descriptions.</li>
<li><code>pixelSize</code>. Number of bytes occupied by each individual pixel,
enabling computation of the size in bytes necessary to step between rows in the
image (<code>stride</code> in bytes = <code>stride</code> in pixels *
<code>pixelSize</code>).</li>
<li><code>format</code>. The pixel format used by the image. The format provided
must be compatible with the platform's OpenGL implementation. To pass
compatibility testing, <code>HAL_PIXEL_FORMAT_YCRCB_420_SP</code> should be
preferred for camera usage, and <code>RGBA</code> or <code>BGRA</code> should
be preferred for display.</li>
<li><code>usage</code>. Usage flags set by the HAL implementation. HAL clients
are expected to pass these unmodified (for details, refer to
<code>Gralloc.h</code> related flags).</li>
<li><code>bufferId</code>. A unique value specified by the HAL implementation to
allow a buffer to be recognized after a round trip through the HAL APIs. The
value stored in this field may be arbitrarily chosen by the HAL implementation.
<li><code>memHandle</code>. The handle for the underlying memory buffer that
contains the image data. The HAL implementation might choose to store a Gralloc
buffer handle here.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ievscamerastream-hw">IEvsCameraStream</h3>

<p>The client implements this interface to receive asynchronous video frame
deliveries.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
deliverFrame(BufferDesc buffer);
</pre>

<p>Receives calls from the HAL each time a video frame is ready for inspection.
Buffer handles received by this method must be returned via calls to
<code>IEvsCamera::doneWithFrame()</code>. When the video stream is stopped via a
call to <code>IEvsCamera::stopVideoStream()</code>, this callback might continue
as the pipeline drains. Each frame must still be returned; when the last frame
in the stream has been delivered, a NULL bufferHandle will be delivered,
signifying the end of the stream and no further frame deliveries occur. The NULL
bufferHandle itself does not need to be sent back via
<code>doneWithFrame()</code>, but all other handles must be returned</p>

<p>While proprietary buffer formats are technically possible, compatibility
testing requires the buffer be in one of four supported formats: NV21 (YCrCb
4:2:0 Semi-Planar), YV12 (YCrCb 4:2:0 Planar), YUYV (YCrCb 4:2:2 Interleaved),
RGBA (32 bit R:G:B:x), BGRA (32 bit B:G:R:x). The selected format must be a valid
GL texture source on the platform's GLES implementation.</p>

<p>The application should <strong>not</strong> rely on any correspondence
between the <code>bufferId</code> field and the <code>memHandle</code> in the
<code>BufferDesc</code> structure. The <code>bufferId</code> values are
essentially private to the HAL driver implementation, and it may use (and reuse)
them as it sees fit.</p>

<h3 id="ievsdisplay-hw">IEvsDisplay</h3>

<p>This object represents the Evs display, controls the state of the display,
and handles the actual presentation of images.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
getDisplayInfo() generates (DisplayDesc info);
</pre>

<p>Returns basic information about the EVS display provided by the system (see
<a href="#displaydesc">DisplayDesc</a>).</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
setDisplayState(DisplayState state) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Sets the display state. Clients may set the display state to express the
desired state, and the HAL implementation must gracefully accept a request for
any state while in any other state, although the response may be to ignore the
request.</p>

<p>Upon initialization, the display is defined to start in the
<code>NOT_VISIBLE</code> state, after which the client is expected to request
the <code>VISIBLE_ON_NEXT_FRAME</code> state and begin providing video. When the
display is no longer required, the client is expected to request the
<code>NOT_VISIBLE</code> state after passing the last video frame.</p>

<p>It is valid for any state to be requested at any time. If the display is
already visible, it should remain visible if set to
<code>VISIBLE_ON_NEXT_FRAME</code>. Always returns OK unless the requested state
is an unrecognized enum value, in which case <code>INVALID_ARG</code> is
returned.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
getDisplayState() generates (DisplayState state);
</pre>

<p>Gets the display state. The HAL implementation should report the actual
current state, which might differ from the most recently requested state. The
logic responsible for changing display states should exist above the device
layer, making it undesirable for the HAL implementation to spontaneously change
display states.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
getTargetBuffer() generates (handle bufferHandle);
</pre>

<p>Returns a handle to a frame buffer associated with the display. This buffer
may be locked and written to by software and/or GL. This buffer must be returned
via a call to <code>returnTargetBufferForDisplay()</code> even if the display is
no longer visible.</p>

<p>While proprietary buffer formats are technically possible, compatibility testing
requires the buffer be in one of four supported formats: NV21 (YCrCb 4:2:0
Semi-Planar), YV12 (YCrCb 4:2:0 Planar), YUYV (YCrCb 4:2:2 Interleaved), RGBA
(32 bit R:G:B:x), BGRA (32 bit B:G:R:x). The selected format must be a valid GL
render target on the platform's GLES implementation.</p>

<p>On error, a buffer with a null handle is returned, but such a buffer does not
need to be passed back to <code>returnTargetBufferForDisplay</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
returnTargetBufferForDisplay(handle bufferHandle) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Tells the display the buffer is ready for display. Only buffers retrieved
through a call to <code>getTargetBuffer()</code> are valid for use with this
call, and the contents of the <code>BufferDesc</code> may not be modified by the
client application. After this call, the buffer is no longer valid for use by
the client. Returns OK on success, or appropriate error code potentially
including <code>INVALID_ARG</code> or <code>BUFFER_NOT_AVAILABLE</code>.</p>

<a name="displaydesc"></a>
<pre class="prettyprint">
struct DisplayDesc {
     string  display_id;
     int32   vendor_flags;  // Opaque value
}
</pre>

<p>Describes the basic properties of an EVS display and required by an EVS
implementation. The HAL is responsible for filling out this structure to
describe the EVS display. Can be a physical display or a virtual display that is
overlaid or mixed with another presentation device.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>display_id</code>. A string that uniquely identifies the display.
This could be the kernel device name of the device, or a name for the device,
such as "rearview". The value for this string is chosen by the HAL
implementation and used opaquely by the stack above.</li>
<li><code>vendor_flags</code>. A method for passing specialized camera
information opaquely from the driver to a custom EVS Application. It is passed
uninterpreted from the driver up to the EVS Application, which is free to ignore
it.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum DisplayState : uint32 {
    NOT_OPEN,               // Display has not been “opened” yet
    NOT_VISIBLE,            // Display is inhibited
    VISIBLE_ON_NEXT_FRAME,  // Will become visible with next frame
    VISIBLE,                // Display is currently active
    DEAD,                   // Display is not available. Interface should be closed
}
</pre>

<p>Describes the state of the EVS display, which can be <em>disabled</em> (not
visible to the driver) or <em>enabled</em> (showing an image to the driver).
Includes a transient state where the display is not visible yet but is prepared
to become visible with the delivery of the next frame of imagery via the
<code>returnTargetBufferForDisplay()</code> call.</p>

<h2 id="evs-manager">EVS Manager</h2>
<p>The EVS Manager provides the public interface to the EVS system for
collecting and presenting external camera views. Where hardware drivers allow
only one active interface per resource (camera or display), the EVS Manager
facilitates shared access to the cameras. A single primary EVS application is
the first client of the EVS Manager, and is the only client permitted to write
display data (additional clients can be granted read-only access to camera
images).</p>

<p>The EVS Manager implements the same API as the underlying HAL drivers and
provides expanded service by supporting multiple concurrent clients (more than
one client can open a camera through the EVS Manager and receive a video
stream).</p>

<figure id="evs-manager">
<img src="/devices/automotive/images/vhal_evs_manager.png" alt="EVS Manager and
EVS Hardware API diagram.">
<figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> EVS Manager mirrors underlying EVS
Hardware API</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Applications see no differences when operating through the EVS Hardware HAL
implementation or the EVS Manager API except that the EVS Manager API allows
concurrent camera stream access. The EVS Manager is, itself, the one allowed
client of the EVS Hardware HAL layer, and acts as a proxy for the EVS Hardware
HAL.</p>

<p>The following sections describe only those calls that have a different
(extended) behavior in the EVS Manager implementation; remaining calls are
identical to EVS HAL descriptions.</p>

<h3 id="ievsenumerator">IEvsEnumerator</h3>

<pre class="prettyprint">
openCamera(string camera_id) generates (IEvsCamera camera);
</pre>

<p>Obtains an interface object used to interact with a specific camera
identified by the unique <em>camera_id</em> string. Returns a NULL on failure.
At the EVS Manager layer, as long as sufficient system resources are available,
a camera that is already open may be opened again by another process, allowing
teeing of the video stream to multiple consumer applications. The
<code>camera_id</code> strings at the EVS Manager layer are the same as those
reported to the EVS Hardware layer.</p>

<h3 id="ievscamera">IEvsCamera</h3>

<p>The EVS Manager provided IEvsCamera implementation is internally virtualized
so operations on a camera by one client do not affect other clients, which
retain independent access to their cameras.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
startVideoStream(IEvsCameraStream receiver) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Starts video streams. Clients may independently start and stop video streams
on the same underlying camera. The underlying camera starts when the first
client starts.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
doneWithFrame(uint32 frameId, handle bufferHandle) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Returns a frame. Each client must return their frames when they are done, but
are permitted to hold onto their frames for as long as they desire. When the
frame count held by a client reaches its configured limit, it will not receive
any more frames until it returns one. This frame skipping does not affect other
clients, which continue to receive all frames as expected.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
stopVideoStream();
</pre>

<p>Stops a video stream. Each client can stop its video stream any time without
affecting other clients. The underlying camera stream at the hardware layer is
stopped when the last client of a given camera stops its stream.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
setExtendedInfo(int32 opaqueIdentifier, int32 opaqueValue) generates (EvsResult result);
</pre>

<p>Sends a driver-specific value, potentially enabling one client to affect
another client. Because the EVS Manager cannot understand the implications of
vendor-defined control words, they are not virtualized and any side effects
apply to all clients of a given camera. For example, if a vendor used this call
to change frame rates, all clients of the affected hardware layer camera would
receive frames at the new rate.</p>

<h3 id="ievsdisplay">IEvsDisplay</h3>

<p>Only one owner of the display is allowed, even at the EVS Manager level. The
Manager adds no functionality and simply passess the IEvsDisplay interface
directly through to the underlying HAL implementation.</p>

<h2 id="evs-application">EVS application</h2>

<p>Android 8.0 includes a native C++ reference implementation of an EVS
application that communicates with the EVS Manager and the Vehicle HAL to
provide basic rear view camera functions. The application is expected to start
very early in the system boot process, with suitable video shown depending on
the available cameras and the state of the car (gear and turn signal state).
OEMs can modify or replace the EVS application with their own vehicle-specific
logic and presentation.</p>

<img src="/devices/automotive/images/vhal_evs_get_camera.png">
<figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> EVS application sample logic, get camera
list.</figcaption>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/devices/automotive/images/vhal_evs_receive_frame.png">
<figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> EVS application sample logic, receive
frame callback.</figcaption>

<p>Because image data is presented to the application in a standard graphics
buffer, the application is responsible for moving the image from the source
buffer into the output buffer.  While this introduces the cost of a data copy,
it also offers the opportunity for the application to render the image into the
display buffer in any fashion it desires.</p>

<p>For example, the application may choose to move the pixel data itself,
potentially with an inline scale or rotation operation. The application could
also choose to use the source image as an OpenGL texture and render a complex
scene to the output buffer, including virtual elements such as icons,
guidelines, and animations. A more sophisticated application may also select
multiple concurrent input cameras and merge them into the single output frame
(such as for use in a top-down, virtual view of vehicle surroundings).</p>

<h2 id="beyond-android-o">Beyond Android 8.0</h2>

<p>Android 8.0 provides support for basic rearview camera applications, but
Google recognizes several use cases that may become the basis for future
extensions to the EVS stack.</p>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Google reserves the right to change
release features at any time.</aside>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surround view</strong>. To address use cases where vehicles have
multiple cameras around the car body, Google is considering enhancing the EVS
application to warp video from multiple concurrent cameras into a 3D
presentation suitable for tight quarter maneuvering (such as parking in a narrow
space).</li>
<li><strong>User input</strong>. In Android 8.0, it is the responsibility of the
application to acquire and parse input events from the kernel device. Reading
user input early in the boot cycle can be accomplished by interacting with the
dev/event# kernel devices, and reading events from these streams does not
interfere with Android InputFlinger's ability to monitor these same input
streams. To address use cases for input events, Google is considering a simple
EVS interface that supports single-touch events.</li>
