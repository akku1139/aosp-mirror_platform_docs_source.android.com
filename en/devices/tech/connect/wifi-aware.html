<p>
The <a
href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifi-aware.html">Wi-Fi
Aware</a> feature in the Android 8.1 (O MR1) release enables supporting devices to
connect to one another directly over Wi-Fi without internet or cellular network
access. This feature, built upon the <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/">Wi-Fi
Alliance</a> <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-aware">Wi-Fi
Aware specification</a> (version 2.0), allows easy sharing of high-throughput
data among trusted devices and apps that are otherwise off network.
</p>

<h2 id="examples-and-source">Examples and source</h2>

<p>
To use this feature, device manufacturers should implement the Wi-Fi Hardware
Interface Design Language (HIDL) provided in the Android Open Source Project
(AOSP). In the Android 8.0 (O) release, HIDL replaces the previous Hardware
Abstraction Layer (HAL) structure used in order to streamline implementations by
specifying types and method calls collected into interfaces and packages.
</p>

<p>
Follow the Wi-Fi HIDL to employ the Wi-Fi aware feature:
hardware/interfaces/wifi/1.0. The Wi-Fi Aware HAL surface is very large; the
<a href
    ="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/master/wifi/1.0/README-NAN.md">hardware/interfaces/wifi/1.0/README-NAN.md</a>
file describes the subset which is currently in use.
</p>

<p>
You may reference the legacy Wi-Fi HAL to see how it correlates with the new
HIDL interface:
<a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/libhardware_legacy/+/master/include/hardware_legacy/wifi_nan.h">hardware/libhardware_legacy/+/master/include/hardware_legacy/wifi_nan.h</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>
Device manufacturers need to provide both framework and HAL/firmware support:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Framework:
  <ul>
    <li>AOSP code</li>
    <li>Enable Aware: requires both a feature flag and an HIDL build flag</li>
  </ul>
    <li>Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) HAL support (which implies firmware support)</li>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To implement this feature, device manufacturers implement the Wi-Fi HIDL and
also enable two feature flags:
</p>

<p>
In <code>BoardConfig.mk</code>, add this flag to tell the Wi-Fi HIDL to include
the Wi-Fi Aware feature:
<code>WIFI_HIDL_FEATURE_AWARE := true</code>
</p>

<p>
And in <code>device.mk</code>, modify the <code>PRODUCT_COPY_FILES</code>
environment variable to include support for the Wi-Fi Aware feature:
<code>PRODUCT_COPY_FILES +=
frameworks/native/data/etc/android.hardware.wifi.aware.xml:system/etc/permissions/android.hardware.wifi.aware.xml</code>
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, everything required for this feature is included in AOSP.
</p>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>
Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) tests exist for this feature. CTS detects
when the feature is enabled and automatically includes the associated tests.
</p>

<p>
This feature can also be tested using the <a
href="/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed/fundamentals/vts">Vendor
Test Suite (VTS)</a> and <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/test/connectivity/+/master/acts/tests/google/wifi/">acts/sl4a</a>,
a test suite that conducts extensive integration testing.
</p>

<p>
The acts/sl4a test suite, described in
<a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/test/connectivity/+/master/acts/tests/google/wifi/aware/README.md">tools/test/connectivity/acts/tests/google/wifi/aware/README.md</a>,
provides functional, performance, and stress tests.
