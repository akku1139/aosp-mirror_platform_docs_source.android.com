<p>
The VTS Dashboard provides a user backend and user interface for viewing test
results from the VTS continuous integration system. It supports test-driven
development with tools such as test status notifications to help developers to
locate and prevent regression areas during the development cycle (include test
monitoring and
triaging support).
</p>

<p>
The user interface supports new features (such as native code coverage) provided
by the VTS infrastructure and enables the development of tools with optimized
and well-characterized performance by offering continuous performance
monitoring.
</p>

<h2 id=requirements>Requirements</h2>
<p>
The following services are required to use the VTS Dashboard:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>, for building and
deployment</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine">Google Cloud App Engine</a>,
for web-service hosting</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/">Google Cloud
Datastore</a>, for storage</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stackdriver.com/">Google Stackdriver</a>, for
monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>
Viewing <a href="/devices/architecture/testing/ui.html#coverage">test
coverage</a> relies on a REST API to a source code server (e.g. Gerrit), which
enables the web service to fetch original source code according to existing
access control lists.
</p>

<h2 id=arch>Architecture</h2>
<p>
The VTS Dashboard uses the following architecture:
</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong>. VTS Dashboard architecture.</figcaption>

<p>
Test status results are continuously uploaded to the Cloud Datastore database
via a REST interface. The VTS runner automatically processes the results and
serializes them using the Protobuf format.
</p>
<p>
Web servlets form the primary access point for users, delivering and processing
data from the Datastore database. The servlets include: a main servlet for
delivering all of the tests, a preferences servlet for managing user favorites,
a results servlet for populating a test table, a graph servlet for preparing
profiling data, and a coverage servlet for preparing coverage data for the
client.
</p>
<p>
Each test module has its own Datastore ancestry tree and test results are
indexed with the Unix timestamp of the test start time. Coverage data in the
database is stored with the test results as a vector of counts (i.e. for each
line in the original source file) and identifying information to fetch the
source code from a source code server.
</p>
<p>
The notification service runs using task queues, identifying test case status
changes, and notifying subscribers. Stateful information is stored in a status
table to keep track of data freshness and existing failures. This allows for the
notification service to provide rich information about individual test case
failures and fixes.
</p>

<h2 id=code-structure>Code structure</h2>
<p>
VTS Dashboard essential components include the servlets implemented in Java,
the front-end JSPs, CSS stylesheets, and configuration files. The following list
details the locations and descriptions of these components (all paths relative
to <code>test/vts/web/dashboard</code>):
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pom.xml</code><br>Settings file where environment variables and
dependencies are defined.</li>
<li><code>src/main/java/com/android/vts/api/</code><br>Contains endpoints for
interacting with the data via REST.</li>
<li><code>src/main/java/com/android/vts/entity/</code><br>Contains Java models
of the Datastore entities.</li>
<li><code>src/main/java/com/android/vts/proto/</code><br>Contains Java files
for Protobuf, including <code>VtsReportMessage.java</code>, which is a Java
implementation of Protobuf type used to describe VTS test results.</li>
<li><code>src/main/java/com/android/vts/servlet/</code><br>Contains Java
files for servlets.</li>
<li><code>src/main/java/com/android/vts/util/</code><br>Contains Java files
for utility functions and classes used by the servlets.</li>
<li><code>src/test/java/com/android/vts/</code><br>Contains UI tests for the
servlets and utils.</li>
<li><code>src/main/webapp/</code><br>Contains files related to the UI (JSP,
CSS, XML):
 <ul>
 <li><code>js/</code>. Contains Javascript files used by the web pages.</li>
 <li><code>WEB-INF/</code>. Contains configuration and UI files.</li>
 <li><code>jsp/</code>. Contains the JSP files for each web page.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li><code>appengine-web.xml</code><br>Settings file where environment
variables are loaded into variables.</li>
<li><code>web.xml</code><br>Settings file where servlet mappings and
security constraints are defined.</li>
<li><code>cron.xml</code><br>Settings file defining scheduled tasks (i.e.
the notifications service).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=setup>Setting up the Dashboard</h2>
<p>
To set up the VTS Dashboard:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Google Cloud App Engine Project.</li>
<li>Set up the deployment host by installing:
 <ul>
 <li>Java 8</li>
 <li>Google App Engine SDK</li>
 <li>Maven</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Generate an OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the Google Cloud API Manager.</li>
<li>Create a Service Account and create a keyfile.</li>
<li>Add an email address to the App Engine Email API Authorized Senders List.</li>
<li>Set up a Google Analytics Account.</li>
<li>Specify environment variables in the Dashboard <code>pom.xml</code>:
 <ul>
 <li>Set the client ID with the OAuth 2.0 ID (from step 3).</li>
 <li>Set the service client ID with the identifier included in the keyfile (from
 step 4).</li>
 <li>Specify the sender email address for alerts (from step 5).</li>
 <li>Specify an email domain to which all emails will be sent.</li>
 <li>Specify the address to the Gerrit REST server.</li>
 <li>Specify the OAuth 2.0 scope to use for the Gerrit REST server.</li>
 <li>Specify the Google Analytics ID (from step 6).</li>
 <li>Build and deploy the project.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>In a terminal, run <code>mvn clean appengine:update</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id=security>Security considerations</h2>
<p>
Robust coverage information requires access to the original source code.
However, some code may be sensitive and an additional gateway to it may allow
for exploitation of existing access control lists.
</p>
<p>
To avoid this threat, instead of serving the source code with the coverage
information, the Dashboard directly handles a coverage vector (i.e., a vector of
execution counts mapping to the lines in a source file). Along with the coverage
vector, the Dashboard receives a Git project name and path so that the client
can fetch the code from an external source code API. The client browser receives
this information and uses cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in Javascript to
query the source code server for the original source code; the resulting code is
combined with the coverage vector to produce a display.
</p>
<p>
This approach does not widen the attack surface because the Dashboard uses the
user's cookies to authenticate with an outside service. A user who cannot access
source code directly cannot exploit the Dashboard to view sensitive information.
