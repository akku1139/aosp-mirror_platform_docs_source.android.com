  <p>
    Dynamic partitions are a userspace partitioning system for Android. Using
    this partitioning system, you can create, resize, or destroy partitions during
    over-the-air (OTA) updates. With dynamic partitions, vendors no longer
    have to worry about the individual sizes of partitions such as
    <code>system</code>, <code>vendor</code>, and <code>product</code>.
    Instead, the device allocates a <code>super</code> partition, and
    sub-partitions can be sized dynamically within it. Individual partition
    images no longer have to leave empty space for future OTAs. Instead, the
    remaining free space in <code>super</code> is available for all dynamic
    partitions.
