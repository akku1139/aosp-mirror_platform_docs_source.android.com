<p>
  Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} deprecates the APK-based time zone data
  update mechanism (available in Android 8.1 and Android 9) and replaces it with
  an <a href="/devices/tech/ota/apex">APEX-based module update mechanism</a>.
  AOSP continues to include the platform code necessary for OEMs to enable
  APK-based updates, so devices upgrading to Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}
  can still receive partner-provided time zone data updates through APK.
  However, the APK update mechanism shouldn't be used on a production device
  that is also receiving module updates as an APK-based update supersedes an
  APEX-based update (that is, a device that received an APK update would ignore
  APEX-based updates).
</p>

<h2 id="timezone-apex">Time zone updates (Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }}+)</h2>

<p>
  The Time Zone Data module supported in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} and
  higher updates daylight saving time (DST) and time zones on Android devices,
  standardizing data that can change frequently for religious, political, and
  geopolitical reasons.
</p>

<p>
  Updates use the following process:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones" class="external">IANA</a>
  releases an update to the Time Zone Database releases an update in response to
  one or more governments changing a time zone rule in their countries.</li>
  <li>Google or the Android partner prepares a Time Zone Data module update
  (APEX file) containing the updated time zones.</li>
  <li>The end-user device downloads the update, reboots, then applies the
  changes, after which the device's time zone data contains the new time zone
  data from the update.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  For details on modules, see
  <a href="/devices/architecture/modular-system">Modular System Components</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="timezone-apk">Time zone updates (Android 8.1&ndash;9)</h2>

<p>
  In Android 8.1 and Android 9, OEMs can use an APK-based mechanism to push
  updated time zone rules data to devices without requiring a system update.
  This mechanism enables users to receive timely updates (thus extending the
  useful lifetime of an Android device) and enables Android partners to test
  time zone updates independently of system image updates.
</p>

<p>The Android core libraries team provides the necessary data files for
updating time zone rules on a stock Android device. OEMs can choose to use these
data files when creating time zone updates for their devices or can create their
own data files if preferred. In all cases, OEMs retain control over the quality
assurance/testing, timing, and launch of time zone rule updates for their
supported devices.</p>

<h3 id="source-code">Android time zone source code and data</h3>
<p>All stock Android devices, even those not using this feature, need time zone
rules data and must ship with a default set of time zone rules data in the
<code>/system</code> partition. This data is then used by code from the
following libraries in the Android source tree: </p>

<ul>
<li>Managed code from <code>libcore/</code> (for example,
<code>java.util.TimeZone</code>) uses <code>tzdata</code> and
<code>tzlookup.xml</code> files.</li>
<li>Native library code in <code>bionic/</code> (for example, for
<code>mktime</code>, localtime system calls) uses the <code>tzdata</code> file.
</li>
<li>ICU4J/ICU4C library code in <code>external/icu/</code> uses the icu
<code>.dat</code> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>These libraries keep track of overlay files that may be present in the
<code>/data/misc/zoneinfo/current</code> directory. Overlay files are expected
to contain improved time zone rules data, thereby enabling devices to be updated
without changing <code>/system</code>.</p>

<p>Android system components that need time zone rule data check the following
locations first:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>libcore/</code> and <code>bionic/</code> code use the
<code>/data</code> copy of the <code>tzdata</code> and <code>tzlookup.xml</code>
files.</li>
<li>ICU4J/ICU4C code use the files in <code>/data</code> and fall back to
<code>/system</code> files for data that isn't present (for formats, localized
strings, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="distro-files">Distro files</h3>
<p>Distro <code>.zip</code> files contain the data files needed to populate the
<code>/data/misc/zoneinfo/current</code> directory. The distro files also
contain metadata that allows devices to detect versioning issues.</p>
<p>The distro file format is Android-release dependent because the contents
change with the ICU version, Android platform requirements, and other release
changes. Android provides distro files for supported Android releases for every
IANA update (in addition to updating the platform system files). To keep their
devices up to date, OEMs can use these distro files or create their own using
the Android source tree (which contains the scripts and other files needed to
generate distro files).</p>

<h3 id="time-zone-update-components">Time zone update components</h3>
<p>A time zone rules update involves the transmission of distro files to a
device and the safe installation of the files contained within. Transfer and
installation requires the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Platform service functionality
(<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/services/core/java/com/android/server/timezone/RulesManagerService.java"
class="external"><code>timezone.RulesManagerService</code></a>), which is
disabled by default. OEMs must enable the functionality through configuration.
<code>RulesManagerService</code> runs in the system server process and stages
time zone update operations by writing to
<code>/data/misc/zoneinfo/staged</code>. <code>RulesManagerService</code> can
also replace or delete already staged operations.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/TimeZoneUpdater/"
class="external"><code>TimeZoneUpdater</code></a>, a nonupdateable system app
(aka the <em>Updater app</em>). OEMs must include this app in the system image
of devices using the feature.</li>
<li>OEM
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/TimeZoneData/"
class="external"><code>TimeZoneData</code></a>, an updateable system app (aka
the <em>Data app</em>) that carries distro files to the device and makes them
available to the Updater app. OEMs must include this app in the system image of
devices using the feature.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/timezone/+/master/tzdatacheck/"
class="external"><code>tzdatacheck</code></a>, a boot-time binary required for
the correct and safe operation of time zone updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Android source tree contains generic source code for the above
components, which the OEM can choose to use without modification.
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/TimeZoneData/+/master/testing/"
class="external">Test code</a> is provided to enable OEMs to automatically check
that they've enabled the feature correctly.</p>

<h4 id="distro-install">Distro installation</h4>
<p>The distro installation process includes the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Data app is updated</strong> through an app store download or
sideload. The system server process (through
<code>timezone.RulesManagerServer/timezone.PackageTracker</code> classes)
watches for changes to the configured, OEM-specific, Data app package
name.
<br /><br />
<figure>
<img src="images/tz_data_app_updates.png" alt="Data app updates"
id="data-app-updates" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Data app updates</figcaption></figure>
</li>
<li><strong>The system server process triggers an update check</strong> by
broadcasting a targeted intent with a unique, single-use token to the Updater
App. The system server keeps track of the most recent token it generated so it
can determine when the most recent check it triggered has completed; any other
tokens are ignored.
<br /><br />
<figure>
<img src="images/tz_trigger_update.png" alt="Trigger update"
id="trigger-update" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Trigger update check</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li><strong>During the update check</strong>, the Updater app performs the
following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Queries the current device state by calling the RulesManagerService.
<br /><br />
<figure>
<img src="images/tz_call_rulesmanagerservice.png" alt="Call RulesManagerService"
id="call-rulesmanagerservice" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Data app updates, calling
RulesManagerService</figcaption></figure>
</li>
<li>Queries the Data app by querying a well-defined ContentProvider URL and
column specs to get information about the distro.
<br /><br />
<figure>
<img src="images/tz_get_info_distro.png" alt="Get distro information"
id="get-distro-info" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Data app updates, get info about distro
</figcaption></figure>
</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>The Updater app takes the appropriate action</strong> based on the
information it has. Available actions include:
<ul>
<li><em>Request an installation.</em> Distro data is read from the Data app
and is passed to the RulesManagerService in the system server. The
RulesManagerService reconfirms that the distro format version and content is
appropriate for the device and stages the install.</li>
<li><em>Request an uninstall</em> (this is rare). For example, if the updated
APK in <code>/data</code> is being disabled or uninstalled and the device is
returning to the version present in <code>/system</code>.</li>
<li><em>Do nothing.</em> Occurs when the Data app distro is found to be invalid.
</li>
</ul>
In all cases, the Updater app calls the RulesManagerService with the check token
so the system server knows that the check is complete and successful.
<br /><br />
<figure>
<img src="images/tz_check_complete.png" alt="Check complete"
id="check-complete" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Check complete</figcaption></figure>
</li>
<li><strong>Reboot and tzdatacheck.</strong> When the device next boots,
the tzdatacheck binary executes any staged operation. The tzdatacheck binary can
perform the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Execute the staged operation by handling the creation, replacement,
and/or deletion of the <code>/data/misc/zoneinfo/current</code> files before
other system components have opened and started to use the files.</li>
<li>Check that the files in <code>/data</code> are correct for the current
platform version, which might not be the case if the device has just received a
system update and the distro format version has changed.</li>
<li>Ensure that the IANA rules version is the same or newer than the version in
<code>/system</code>. This protects against a system update leaving a device
with older time zone rules data than is present in the <code>/system</code>
image.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="reliability">Reliability</h4>
<p>The end-to-end installation process is asynchronous and split across three OS
processes. At any point during the installation, the device may lose power, run
out of disk space, or encounter other issues, causing the installation check to
be incomplete. In the best unsuccessful case, the Updater app informs the system
server that it was unsuccessful; in the worst unsuccessful case, the
RulesManagerService receives no call at all.</p>
<p>To handle this, the system server code keeps track of whether a triggered
update check has completed and what the last checked version code of the Data
App is. When the device is idle and charging, the system server code can check
the current state. If it discovers an incomplete update check or unexpected Data
App version, it spontaneously triggers an update check.</p>

<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>When enabled, the RulesManagerService code in the system server performs
several checks to ensure that the system is safe to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems that indicate a badly configured system image prevent a device
booting; examples include a bad Updater or Data app configuration or the
Updater or Data app not being in <code>/system/priv-app</code>.</li>
<li>Problems that indicate a bad Data app has been installed don't prevent a
device booting but do prevent an update check being triggered; examples
include a lack of required system permissions or the Data app doesn't expose a
ContentProvider on the expected URI.</li>
</ul>

<p>File permissions for the <code>/data/misc/zoneinfo</code> directories are
enforced using SELinux rules. As with any APK, the Data app must be signed by the
same key used to sign the <code>/system/priv-app</code> version. The Data app is
expected to have a dedicated, OEM-specific package name and key.</p>

<h3 id="integrating">Integrating time zone updates</h3>
<p>To enable the time zone update feature, OEMs typically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create their own Data app.</li>
<li>Include the Updater and Data apps in the system image build.</li>
<li>Configure the system server to enable the RulesManagerService.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="preparing">Preparing</h4>
<p>Before starting, OEMs should review the following policy, quality assurance,
and security considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a dedicated app-specific signing key for their Data app.</li>
<li>Create a release and versioning strategy for time zone updates
to understand which devices are going to be updated and how they can ensure that
updates are only installed on devices that need them. For example, OEMs may want
to have a single Data app for all their devices or may choose to have different
Data apps for different devices. The decision impacts the choice of package
name, possibly the version codes used, and the QA strategy.</li>
<li>Understand whether they want to use stock Android timezone data
from AOSP or create their own.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="creating-data-app">Creating a Data app</h4>
<p>AOSP includes all source code and build rules needed to create a Data app in
<code>packages/apps/TimeZoneData</code>, with instructions and example templates
for <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> and other files located in
<code>packages/apps/TimeZoneData/oem_template</code>. Example templates include
both a build target for the real Data app APK and extra targets for
creating test versions of the Data app.</p>
<p>OEMs can customize the Data app with their own icon, name, translations, and
other details. However, as the Data app can't be launched, the icon appears
only in the <em>Settings &gt; Apps</em> screen.</p>
<p>The Data app is intended to be built with a <strong>tapas</strong> build
that produces APKs suitable to be added to the system image (for the initial
release) and signed and distributed through an app store (for subsequent
updates). For details on using tapas, see <a href="#building-tapas">Building the
Data app using tapas</a>.</p>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Securely signing APKs and key
management is outside of the scope of this article.</aside>

<p>OEMs must install the Data app prebuilt in the system image of a device in
<code>/system/priv-app</code>. To include prebuilt APKs (generated by the tapas
build process) in the system image, OEMs can copy the example files in
<code>packages/apps/TimeZoneData/oem_template/data_app_prebuilt</code>. The
example templates also include build targets for including test versions of the
Data app in test suites.</p>

<h4 id="including">Including the Updater and Data apps in the system image</h4>
<p>OEMs must place the Updater and Data app APKs in the
<code>/system/priv-app</code> directory of the system image. To do this, the
system image build must explicitly include the Updater app and Data app prebuilt
targets.</p>
<p>The Updater app should be signed with the platform key and included as any
other system app. The target is defined in
<code>packages/apps/TimeZoneUpdater</code> as <code>TimeZoneUpdater</code>. The
Data app inclusion is OEM-specific and depends on the target name chosen for the
prebuild.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-system-server">Configuring the system server</h4>
<p>To enable time zone updates, OEMs can configure the system server by
overriding configuration properties defined in
<code>frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml</code>.</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td><pre class="prettyprint">config_timeZoneRulesCheckRetryCount</pre></td>
<td>The number of sequential unsuccessful update checks allowed before the

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Configuration overrides should be in the system image (not vendor or other)
as a misconfigured device can refuse to boot. If the configuration overrides
were in the vendor image, updating to a system image without a Data app (or
with different Data app/Updater app package names) would be considered a
misconfiguration.</p>

<h4 id="xts-testing">xTS testing</h4>
<p>xTS refers to any OEM-specific test suite that is similar to standard Android
test suites using Tradefed (such as CTS and VTS). OEMs that have such test
suites can add the Android time zone update tests provided in the following
locations:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>packages/apps/TimeZoneData/testing/xts</code> includes the code
needed for basic automated functional testing.</li>
<li><code>packages/apps/TimeZoneData/oem_template/xts</code> contains a sample
directory structure for including tests in a Tradefed-like xTS suite. As with
other template directories, OEMs are expected to copy and customize to their
needs.</li>
<li><code>packages/apps/TimeZoneData/oem_template/data_app_prebuilt </code>
contains build-time configuration for including the pre-built test APKs required
by the test.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Setting up an OEM-specific test suite
is outside of the scope of this article.</aside>

<h3 id="creating-updates">Creating time zone updates</h3>
<p>When IANA releases a new set of time zone rules, the Android core libraries
team generates patches to update releases in AOSP. OEMs using the stock Android
system and distro files can pick up these commits, use them to create a new
version of their Data app, then release the new version to update their devices
in production.</p>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The following steps don't describe
how to update the base data files in the <code>/system</code> image, which is
required when preparing the factory image or system updates. That process also
generates the distro file for inclusion in the Data app. For instructions on
updating the platform files, refer to
<code>/system/timezone/README.android</code>.</aside>

<p>Because Data apps contain distro files closely tied to Android versions,
OEMs must create a new version of the Data app for <em>every</em> supported
Android release that an OEM wants to update. For example, if an OEM wants to
provide updates for Android 8.1, {{ androidPVersionNumber }}, and {{ androidQVersionNumber }}
devices, they must complete the process three times.</p>

<h4 id="step1">Step 1: Updating system/timezone and external/icu data files</h4>
<p>In this step, OEMs take stock Android commits for
<code>system/timezone</code> and <code>external/icu</code> from the
<em>release</em>-dev branches in AOSP and apply those commits to their copy of
the Android source code.</p>
<p>The system/timezone AOSP patch contains updated files in
<code>system/timezone/input_data</code> and
<code>system/timezone/output_data</code>. OEMs who need to make additional local
fixes can modify the input files then use the files in
<code>system/timezone/input_data</code> and <code>external/icu</code> to
generate files in <code>output_data</code>.</p>
<p>The most important file is
<code>system/timezone/output_data/distro/distro.zip</code>, which is
automatically included when the Data app APK is built.</p>

<h4 id="step2">Step 2: Updating the version code of the Data app</h4>
<p>In this step, OEMs update the version code of the Data app. The build
automatically picks up <code>distro.zip</code>, but the new version of the
Data app must have a new version code so it's recognized as new and is used to
replace a preloaded Data app or a Data app installed on a device by a previous
update.</p>
<p>When building the Data app using files copied from
<code>package/apps/TimeZoneData/oem_template/data_app</code>, you can find the
version code/version name applied to the APK in the <code>Android.mk</code>:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
TIME_ZONE_DATA_APP_VERSION_CODE :=
TIME_ZONE_DATA_APP_VERSION_NAME :=
</pre>

<p>Similar entries can be found in <code>testing/Android.mk</code> (however, the
test version codes must be higher than the system image version). For details,
see the <a href="#example-version-code-strategy">example version code strategy
scheme</a>; if the example scheme or a similar scheme is used, the test
version codes don't need to be updated because they're guaranteed to be higher
than the real version codes.</p>

<h4 id="step3">Step 3: Rebuilding, signing, testing, and releasing</h4>
<p>In this step, OEMs rebuild the APK using tapas, sign the generated
APK, then test and release the APK:</p>
<ul>
<li>For unreleased devices (or when preparing a system update for a
released device), submit the new APKs in the Data app prebuilt directory
to ensure that the system image and xTS tests have the latest APKs. OEMs should
test that the new file works correctly (that is, it passes CTS and any
OEM-specific automated and manual tests).</li>
<li>For released devices that no longer receive system updates, the signed APK
might only be released through an app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>OEMs are responsible for quality assurance and testing the updated
Data app on their devices before release.</p>

<h3 id="version-code-strategy">Data app version code strategy</h3>
<p>The Data app must have a
<a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html#VersionCodes" class="external">suitable
versioning strategy</a> to ensure that devices receive the correct APKs. For
example, if a system update is received that contains an older APK than one
downloaded from the app store, the app store version should be retained.</p>
<p>The APK version code should include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distro format version (major + minor)</li>
<li>An incrementing (opaque) version number</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, platform API level is strongly correlated to distro format version
because each API level is usually associated with a new version of ICU (which
makes the distro files incompatible). In the future, Android may change this so
that a distro file can work across multiple Android platform releases (and API
level isn't used in the Data app version code scheme).</p>

<h4 id="example-version-code-strategy">Example version code strategy</h4>
<p>This example versioning number scheme ensures that higher distro format
versions supersede lower distro format versions.
<code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> uses <code>android:minSdkVersion</code> to
ensure that old devices don't receive versions with a higher distro format
version than they can handle.</p>

<p>The scheme could be packed better if binary were used instead of decimal, but
this scheme has the advantage of being human-readable. If the full number range

<ul>
<li>Examples 1 and 2 show two APK versions for the same 2017a IANA release
with different major format versions. 2 is numerically higher than 1, which is
needed to ensure that newer devices receive the higher format versions. The
minSdkVersion ensures that the P version won't be supplied to O devices.</li>
<li>Example 3 is a revision/fix for 1 and is numerically higher than 1.
</li>
<li>Examples 4 and 5 show the 2017b releases for O-MR1 and P. Being numerically
higher, they replace prior IANA releases/Android revisions of their respective
predecessors.</li>
<li>Examples 6 and 7 show the 2018a releases for O-MR1 and P.</li>
<li>Example 8 demonstrates the use of Y to completely replace the Y=0 scheme.
</li>
<li>Example 9 demonstrates the use of the gap left between 3 and 4 to re-spin
the apk.</li>
</ul>

<p>As each device ships with a default, appropriately versioned APK in the
system image, there's no risk of an O-MR1 version being installed on a P device
because it has a lower version number than a P system image version. A
device with an O-MR1 version installed in <code>/data</code> that then receives
a system update to P uses the <code>/system</code> version in preference to
the O-MR1 version in<code> /data</code> because the P version is always higher
than any app intended for O-MR1.</p>

<h3 id="building-tapas">Building the Data app using tapas</h3>
<p>OEMs are responsible for managing most aspects of the time zone Data app and
configuring the system image correctly. The Data app is intended to be built
with a <strong>tapas</strong> build that produces APKs suitable to be added to
the system image (for the initial release) and signed and distributed through an
app store (for subsequent updates).<p>
<p><strong>Tapas</strong> is a slimmed-down version of the Android build
system that uses a reduced source tree to produce distributable versions of
apps. OEMs familiar with the normal Android build system should recognize the
build files from the normal Android platform build.</p>

<h4 id="creating-manifest">Creating the manifest</h4>
<p>A reduced source tree is usually achieved with a custom manifest file that
refers only to the Git projects needed by the build system and for building the
app. After following the instructions in
<a href="#creating-data-app">Creating a Data app</a>, OEMs should have at
least two OEM-specific Git projects created by using the template files under
<code>packages/apps/TimeZoneData/oem_template</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>One Git project contains app files such as the manifest and the
build files required to create the app APK file (for example,
<code>vendor/<var>oem</var>/apps/TimeZoneData</code>). This project also
contains build rules for test APKs that can be used by xTS tests.</li>
<li>One Git project contains the signed APKs produced by the app build for
inclusion in the system image build and xTS tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>The app build leverages several other Git projects that are shared with the
platform build or contain OEM-independent code libraries.</p>
<p>The following manifest snippet contains the minimal set of Git projects
needed to support an O-MR1 build of the time zone Data app. OEMs
must add their OEM-specific Git projects (which typically include a project that
contains the signing certificate) to this manifest, and may configure different
branches accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="running-tapas">Running the tapas build</h4>
<p>After the source tree is established, invoke the <strong>tapas</strong> build
using the following commands:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">source build/envsetup.sh</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">tapas</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">make -j30 showcommands dist TARGET_BUILD_APPS='TimeZoneData TimeZoneData_test1 TimeZoneData_test2'  TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT=userdebug</code>
</pre>

<p>A successful build generates files in the <code>out/dist</code> directory for
testing. These files can be placed into the prebuilts directory for inclusion in
the system image and/or distributed through an app store for compatible
devices.</p>
