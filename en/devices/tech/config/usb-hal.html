<p>
The Android 8.0 release moves handling of USB commands out of <code>init</code>
scripts and into a native USB daemon for better configuration and code
reliability. For the Gadget function configuration, <code>init</code> scripts
(property triggers) are used to perform device-specific gadget operations.
</p>

<p>
In previous releases, these device-specific configurations were achieved through
device-specific <code>init</code> scripts (using property triggers). Moving to a
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) design results in a much cleaner implementation
that solves these problems:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Operations such as writes to the kernel sysfs nodes could fail but not be
propagated back to the frameworks code that sets the property trigger. As a
result, frameworks incorrectly assumes the operations have succeeded even though
they have silently failed.</li>
<li><code>init</code> scripts have a limited number of operations that could be
executed.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hal-and-treble">HAL and Treble</h2>

<p>
The device-specific <code>init</code> scripts were used as a substitution for
HAL layers to perform device-specific USB operations. USB (through ADB) is a
primary interface for debugging system issues. Having a native daemon to perform
USB configuration eliminates the dependency on the framework code so even if the
framework crashes USB should be running.
</p>

<p>
Under the
  <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html"
     class="external">Treble</a>
model also introduced in Android 8.0, all of the HALs are isolated from System
services and are required to run in their own native daemons. This eliminates
the requirement to have an exclusive USB daemon as the HAL layer nicely doubles
as a USB daemon.
</p>

<p>
The default HAL implementation takes care of all pre-Android 8.0 devices. Therefore, there
wouldn't be any device-specific work for the pre-Android 8.0 devices. Android 8.0 uses the HAL
interface to query the status of USB ports and to perform data role and power
role swaps.
</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>
New USB HAL interface needs to be implemented on every device launching on Android 8.0.
The default implementation should take care of pre-Android 8.0 devices. The default
implementation is sufficient if the device uses the <code>dual_role_usb</code> class to report
type-c port status. Trivial changes might be required in device-specific USB scripts
to transfer ownership of the typc-c nodes to system.
