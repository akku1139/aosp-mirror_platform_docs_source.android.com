<p>In Android 6.0 and higher, the Android application permissions model is designed to make
permissions more understandable, useful, and secure for users. The model moved Android
applications that require dangerous permissions (see
<a href="#affected-permissions">Affected permissions</a>) from an
<em>install-time</em> permission model to a <em>runtime</em> permission model:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Install-time permissions</strong>

  <p>(<em>Android 5.1 and lower</em>) Users grant <a
  href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#dangerous_permissions"
  class="external">dangerous permissions</a> to an app when they install or update the app. Device
  manufacturers and carriers can preinstall apps with pregranted permissions without notifying the
  user.</p></li>

<li><strong>Runtime permissions</strong>

  <p>(<em>Android 6.0 – 9</em>) Users grant dangerous permissions to an app when the app is running.
  When permissions are requested (such as when the app launches or when the user accesses a specific
  feature) depends on the application, but the user grants/denies application access to specific
  permission groups. OEMs/carriers can preinstall apps, but can’t pregrant permissions unless they
  go through the exception process. (See <a
  href="/devices/tech/config/runtime_perms#creating-exceptions">Creating
  exceptions</a>.)</p>

  <p>(<em>Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}</em>) Users see increased transparency and have
  control over which apps have activity recognition (AR) runtime permissions. Users are prompted by
  the <a href="/devices/tech/config/background-location-access#tristate-screen#tristate-screen">
  runtime permissions dialog</a> to either always allow, allow while in use, or deny permissions.
  On an OS upgrade to Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, permissions given to apps are retained,
  but users can go into <strong>Settings</strong> and change them.</p></li></ul>

<p> Runtime permissions prevent apps from gaining access to private data without a user’s consent,
and provide them with additional context and visibility into the types of permissions that
applications are either seeking, or have been granted. The runtime model encourages developers to
help users understand why applications require the requested permissions, and provides greater
transparency so users can make better decisions about granting or denying them.</p>

<h2 id="affected-permissions">Affected permissions</h2>

<p>Android 6.0 and higher requires dangerous permissions to use a runtime permissions model.
Dangerous permissions are higher-risk permissions (such as <code>READ_CALENDAR</code>) that grant
requesting applications access to private user data, or control over a device, which can negatively
impact the user. To view a list of dangerous permissions, run the command:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">adb shell pm list permissions -g -d</pre>

<p> Android 6.0 and higher doesn’t change the behavior of <a
href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#normal_permissions"
class="external">normal permissions</a>. These are all non-dangerous permissions including normal,
system, and signature permissions. Normal permissions are lower-risk permissions (such as
<code>SET_WALLPAPER</code>) that grant requesting applications access to isolated application-level
features with minimal risk to other applications, the system, or the user. As in Android 5.1 and
lower releases, the system automatically grants normal permissions to a requesting application at
installation and doesn’t prompt the user for approval. For details on permissions, see the <a
href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-element.html"
class="external">&lt;permission&gt; element</a> documentation.</p>

<h3 id="hardRestrictions">Hard and soft restrictions in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}</h3>

<p>In addition to being dangerous, a permission can be either hard-restricted
or soft-restricted. In either case, the restricted permission must also be whitelisted. Non-whitelisted
hard restrictions behave differently than non-whitelisted soft
restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(<em>Hard restrictions</em>) Apps can’t be granted permissions that aren’t
whitelisted.</li>
<li>(<em>Soft restrictions</em>) Apps without whitelisting behave according to the
specific permission they request. The behavior is described in the public
documentation for the requested permission.</li>
</ul>

<p>When installing an app, the installer (such as Google Play Store) may select
to not whitelist the restricted permissions for the app. Permissions are
restricted by the platform and are grantable only if an app meets special criteria
per platform policy. Examples of hard-restricted permission types include SMS
and Call Log permissions.</p>

<p>Whitelisting happens during installation, and when</p>

<ul>
<li>an app is already installed during an Android 9-to-{{ androidQVersionNumber
}} upgrade.</li>
<li>a permission is pregranted or an app is preinstalled.</li>
<li>a permission is required for a role that's already defined to whitelist the
permission.</li>
<li>the installer (such as Google Play Store) marks the permission as
white-listed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can’t manually whitelist permissions.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p> The runtime permission model applies to all applications, including pre-installed apps and apps
delivered to the device as part of the setup process. Application software requirements include:
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The runtime permission model must be consistent across all devices running Android 6.0
        and higher. This is enforced by Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) tests.</li>
        <li>Apps must prompt users to grant application permissions at runtime. For details, see <a
        href="#updating-apps">Updating
        applications</a>. Limited exceptions may be granted to default applications and handlers
        that provide basic device functionality fundamental to the expected operation of the device.
        (For example, the device's default Dialer app for handling <code>ACTION_CALL</code> may have
        Phone permission access.) For details, see <a
        href="#creating-exceptions">Creating exceptions</a>.</li>
        <li>Preloaded apps that have dangerous permissions
        must target API level 23 and maintain the runtime permission model. That is, the UI flow
        during app installation mustn’t deviate from the AOSP implementation of
        PermissionController, users can revoke dangerous permissions of preinstalled apps, and so
        on.</li>
        <li>Headless applications must use an activity to request permissions or to share a
        UID with another application that has the necessary permissions. For details, see <a
        href="#headless-apps">Headless
          applications</a>.</li></ul>

<h2 id="permissions-migration">Permissions migration</h2>

<p>Permissions granted to applications on Android 5.x remain granted after updating to Android 6.0
or higher, but users can revoke those permissions at any time.</p>

<p>In an Android 9-to-{{ androidQVersionNumber }} update, all hard-restricted permissions get
whitelisted. For details on implementing the foreground/background split permissions, see <a
href="https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/device-location" class="external">Android {{
androidQVersionNumber }} privacy change</a>, beginning with <a
href="https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/device-location#request-background-location"
class="external">Request background location</a>.</p>

<h2 id="integration">Integration</h2>

<p>When integrating the application runtime permissions model for Android 6.0 and higher, you must
update preinstalled applications to work with the new model. You can also define exceptions for apps
that are the default handlers/providers for core functionality, define custom permissions, and
customize the theme used in the <code><strong>PermissionController</strong></code> app.</p>

<h3 id="updating-apps">Updating applications</h3>

<p> Applications on the system image and preinstalled applications aren’t automatically pregranted
permissions. We encourage you to work with preinstalled app developers (OEM, carrier, and third
party) to make the required app modifications using <a
href="https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/index.html" class="external">developer
guidelines</a>. Specifically, you must ensure that preinstalled applications are modified to avoid
crashes and other issues when users revoke permissions.</p>

<h4 id="preloaded-apps">Pre-loaded applications</h4>

<p> In Android 9 and lower, preloaded apps that use dangerous permissions must target API level 23
or higher, and maintain the Android 6.0 and higher AOSP permission model. For example, the UI flow
during an app installation mustn’t deviate from the AOSP implementation of
<code>PermissionController</code>. Users can even revoke the dangerous permissions of
preinstalled apps.</p>

<p>In Android 6.0 through 9, some permissions are granted during the install flow. However, starting
in {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the install flow (performed by the <strong><code>Package
Installer</code></strong> app) is a separate function from permissions granting (in the
<strong><code>Permission Controller</code></strong> app).</p>

<h4 id="headless-apps">Headless applications</h4>

<p>
Only activities can request permissions. Services can’t request permissions directly.
</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In Android 5.1 and earlier, headless applications can request permissions when
          installed, or if they were pre-installed without the use of an activity.</li>
          <li>In
          Android 6.0 and higher, headless applications must use one of the following methods to
          request permissions:</li>

          <ul> <li>Add an activity to request permissions. (This is the preferred method.)</li>
          <li>Share a UID with another application that has the necessary permissions. Use this
          method only when you need the platform to handle multiple APKs as a single
          application.</li></ul></ul>

<p> The goal is to avoid confusing users with permission requests that appear out of context.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-package-install">Customizing the PackageInstaller UI</h3>

<p>If desired, you can customize the Permissions UI <strong>theme</strong> by
updating the default device themes (<code>Theme.DeviceDefault.Settings</code>
and <code>Theme.DeviceDefault.Light.Dialog.NoActionBar</code>) used by
PackageInstaller. However, because consistency is critical for app developers,
you can't customize the placement, position, and rules of when the Permissions
UI appears.</p>

<p>To include <strong>strings</strong> for additional languages, contribute the
strings to AOSP.</p>

<h3 id="creating-exceptions">Creating exceptions</h3>

<p>You can pre-grant permissions to applications that are default handlers or
providers for core OS functionality using the
<code>DefaultPermissionGrantPolicy.java</code> class in PackageManager. Examples:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
ACTION_CALL (Dialer) Default
Phone, Contacts, SMS, Microphone
</pre>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
SMS_DELIVER_ACTION (SMS/MMS) Default
Phone, Contacts, SMS
</pre>

<h3 id="defining-custom-perms">Defining custom permissions</h3>

<p>You can define custom permissions and groups as <em>normal</em> or
<em>dangerous</em> and add OEM/Carrier-specific permissions to existing
permissions groups, just as you could in Android 5.x and earlier releases.</p>

<p>In Android 6.0 and later, if you add a new dangerous permission, it must be handled in
the same way as other dangerous permissions (requested during app runtime and
revocable by users). Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can add new permissions to a current group, but you can't modify the
AOSP mapping of dangerous permissions and dangerous permissions groups. (In other words, you
can't remove a permission from a group and assign to another group).</li>
<li>You can add new permission groups in applications installed on the device,
but you can't add new permissions groups in the platform manifest.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing-perms">Testing permissions</h2>

<p>Android includes Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) tests that verify
individual permissions are mapped to the correct groups. Passing these tests is
a requirement for Android 6.0 and later CTS compatibility.</p>
