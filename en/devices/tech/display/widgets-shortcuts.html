    <p>
    The new flow API for adding shortcuts and widgets in Android 8.0 allows
    application developers to add shortcuts and widgets from inside the app instead
    of relying on the widget tray. It also deprecates the old method (sending a
    broadcast) of adding shortcuts for security reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
    Launchers need to support this new implementation so that app developers can
    rely on the system to add their shortcut or widget.
    </p>
    <h2 id="examples-and-source">Examples and source</h2>
    <p>
    Docs are available in various system class. References include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ShortcutManager.html">ShortuctManager.java</a></b><br>
      Publish Pinned shortcut section in header.
      <li><b>Intent.java</b><br>Javadoc for ACTION_CREATE_SHORTCUT.</li>
      <li><b>AppWidgetManager.java</b><br>Javadoc for requestPinAppWidget.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
    <p>
    Device implementers need to add an activity in their launcher with intent filter actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>android.content.pm.action.CONFIRM_PIN_SHORTCUT</code></li>
      <li><code>android.content.pm.action.CONFIRM_PIN_APPWIDGET</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Refer to the <a
    href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/LauncherApps.html">API
    documentation</a> for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
    This activity should display a confirmation prompt to the user to add the <a
    href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/LauncherApps.html">requested
    widget/shortcut</a> and upon accepting, add the corresponding widget/shortcut on
    the homescreen.
    </p>
    <p>
    In case of widgets, the <code>accept()</code> call should include the widget ID
    of the newly added widget.
    </p>

    <p>
    Partners need to update their Launcher app using the Launcher3 implementation
    (<code>packages/apps/Launcher3</code>) as reference.
    </p>
    <p>
    Relevant Launcher3 changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change-Id: I664366822fe8088742faff2cce006239ab0771bc
      <li>Change-Id: I905532ba44a8898c9c17476f9f75bc309eeb7b41
    </ul>
    <h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
    <p>
    To validate the feature, try to add shortcuts from Chrome or the Contacts app
    and verify that a proper confirmation prompt is shown. Upon accepting, the icon
    should get added on the homescreen and Chrome should display a success toast.
