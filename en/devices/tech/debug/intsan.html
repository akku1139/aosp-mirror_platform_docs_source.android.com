<p>
Unintended integer overflows can cause memory corruption or information
disclosure vulnerabilities in variables associated with memory accesses or
memory allocations. To combat this, we added Clang's
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer</a>
(UBSan) signed and unsigned integer overflow sanitizers to
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/05/hardening-media-stack.html">harden
the media framework</a> in Android 7.0. In Android 9, we
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/compiler-based-security-mitigations-in.html">expanded
UBSan to cover more components</a> and improved build system support for it.
</p>
<p>
If a signed or unsigned integer overflows, overflow sanitization is designed to
safely abort process execution by instrumenting arithmetic instructions which
may overflow. These sanitizers can mitigate an entire class of memory corruption
and information disclosure vulnerabilities where the root cause is an integer
overflow, such as the original Stagefright vulnerability.
</p>
<h2 id="examples-and-source">Examples and source</h2>
<p>
Integer Overflow Sanitization (IntSan) is provided by the compiler and adds
instrumentation into the binary during compile time to detect arithmetic
overflows. It is enabled by default in various components throughout the
platform, for example
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libnl/+/master/Android.bp#64"><code>/platform/external/libnl/Android.bp</code></a>.
</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>
IntSan uses UBSan's signed and unsigned integer overflow sanitizers. This
mitigation is enabled on a per-module level. It helps keep critical components
of Android secure and should not be disabled.
</p>
<p>
We strongly encourage you to enable Integer Overflow Sanitization for additional
components. Ideal candidates are privileged native code or native code that
parses untrusted user input. There is a small performance overhead associated
with the sanitizer that is dependent on code's usage and the prevalence of
arithmetic operations. Expect a small overhead percentage and test if
performance is a concern.
</p>
<h3 id="intsan-in-makefiles">Supporting IntSan in makefiles</h3>
<p>
To enable IntSan in a makefile, add:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">LOCAL_SANITIZE := integer_overflow
# Optional features
LOCAL_SANITIZE_DIAG := integer_overflow
LOCAL_SANITIZE_BLACKLIST := modulename_blacklist.txt</pre>
<ul>
  <li><code>LOCAL_SANITIZE</code> takes a comma separated list of sanitizers,
    with <code>integer_overflow</code> being a pre-packaged set of options for
    the individual signed and unsigned integer overflow sanitizers with a
    <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/master/cc/config/integer_overflow_blacklist.txt">default
    blacklist</a>.</li>
  <li><code>LOCAL_SANITIZE_DIAG</code> turns on diagnostics mode for the
    sanitizers. Use diagnostics mode only during testing because this will not
    abort on overflows, completely negating the security advantage of the
    mitigation. See <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>
    for additional details.</li>
  <li><code>LOCAL_SANITIZE_BLACKLIST</code> allows you to specify a blacklist
    file to prevent functions and source files from being sanitized. See
    <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> for additional
    details.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want more granular control, enable the sanitizers individually using one
or both flags:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">LOCAL_SANITIZE := signed-integer-overflow, unsigned-integer-overflow
LOCAL_SANITIZE_DIAG := signed-integer-overflow, unsigned-integer-overflow</pre>

<aside class="caution"><strong>Caution</strong>: The individual sanitizers <strong>must</strong>
be specified as above for static binaries/libraries; the
<code>integer_overflow</code> flag does not support static binaries/libraries.
Use both signed and unsigned sanitizers when specifying individually.</aside>

<h3 id="intsan-in-bp">Supporting IntSan in blueprint files</h3>
<p>
To enable integer overflow sanitization in a blueprint file, such as
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libnl/+/master/Android.bp#64"><code>/platform/external/libnl/Android.bp</code></a>,
add:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint">   sanitize: {
      integer_overflow: true,
      diag: {
          integer_overflow: true,
      },
      blacklist: "modulename_blacklist.txt",
   },</pre>
<p>
As with make files, the <code>integer_overflow</code> property is a pre-packaged
set of options for the individual signed and unsigned integer overflow
sanitizers with a <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/master/cc/config/integer_overflow_blacklist.txt">default
blacklist</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>diag</code> set of properties enables diagnostics mode for the
sanitizers. Use diagnostics mode only during testing. Diagnostics mode doesn't
abort on overflows, which completely negates the security advantage of the
mitigation in user builds. See <a
href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> for additional details.
</p>
<p>
The <code>blacklist</code> property allows specification of a blacklist file
that allows developers to prevent functions and source files from being
sanitized. See <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> for
additional details.
</p>
<p>
To enable the sanitizers individually, use:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">   sanitize: {
      misc_undefined: ["signed-integer-overflow", "unsigned-integer-overflow"],
      diag: {
          misc_undefined: ["signed-integer-overflow",
                           "unsigned-integer-overflow",],
      },
      blacklist: "modulename_blacklist.txt",
   },</pre>
<aside class="caution"><strong>Caution</strong>: The individual sanitizers <strong>must</strong>
be specified as above for static binaries/libraries in Android 9; the
<code>integer_overflow</code> flag does not support static binaries/libraries.
Use both signed and unsigned sanitizers when specifying individually.</aside>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>
If you are enabling integer overflow sanitization in new components, or rely on
platform libraries that have had integer overflow sanitization, you may run into
a few issues with benign integer overflows causing aborts. You should test
components with sanitization enabled to ensure benign overflows can be surfaced.
</p>
<p>
To find, aborts caused by sanitization in user builds, search for
<code>SIGABRT</code> crashes with Abort messages indicating an overflow caught
by UBSan, such as:
</p>


<pre
class="prettyprint">pid: ###, tid: ###, name: Binder:###  &gt;&gt;&gt; /system/bin/surfaceflinger &lt;&lt;&lt;
signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -6 (SI_TKILL), fault addr --------
Abort message: 'ubsan: sub-overflow'</pre>

<p>
The stack trace should include the function causing the abort, however,
overflows that occur in inline functions may not be evident in the stack trace.
</p>
<p>
To more easily determine the root cause, enable diagnostics in the library
triggering the abort and attempt to reproduce the error. <strong>With
diagnostics enabled, the process will not abort</strong> and will instead
continue to run. Not aborting helps maximize the number of benign overflows in a
particular execution path without having to recompile after fixing each bug.
Diagnostics produces an error message which includes the line number and source
file causing the abort:
</p>


<pre
class="prettyprint">frameworks/native/services/surfaceflinger/SurfaceFlinger.cpp:2188:32: runtime error: unsigned integer overflow: 0 - 1 cannot be represented in type 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned long')</pre>
<p>
Once the problematic arithmetic operation is located, ensure that the overflow
is benign and intended (e.g. has no security implications). You can address the
sanitizer abort by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring the code to avoid the overflow (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/572808">example</a>)
<li>Overflow explicitly via Clang's <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#checked-arithmetic-builtins">__builtin_*_overflow</a>
functions (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/588160">example</a>)
<li>Disabling sanitization the function via an attribute (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/531720">example</a>)
<li>Disabling sanitization of a function or source file via a blacklist file (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/574222">example</a>)</li></ul>
<p>
You should use the most granular solution possible. For example, a large
function with many arithmetic operations and a single overflowing operation
should have the single operation refactored rather than the entire function
blacklisted.
</p>
<p>
Common patterns that may result in benign overflows include:
</p><ul>
<li>Implicit casts where an unsigned overflow occurs before being cast to a
signed type (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/av/+/574011">example</a>)
<li>Linked list deletions which decrements the loop index on deletion (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/base/+/588158">example</a>)
<li>Assigning an unsigned type to -1 as shorthand for the max value (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/574088/1/services/surfaceflinger/Layer.cpp">example</a>)
<li>Loops which decrement an unsigned integer in the condition (<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/573763/1/services/inputflinger/InputReader.cpp">example</a>,
<a
href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/rs/+/572756">example</a>)</li></ul>
<p>
It is recommended that developers assure that cases where the sanitizer detects
an overflow that it is indeed benign with no unintended side-effects or security
implications before disabling sanitization.
</p>
<h3 id="disabling-intsan">Disabling IntSan</h3>
<p>
You can disable IntSan with blacklists or function attributes. Disable sparingly
and only when refactoring the code is otherwise unreasonable or if there is
problematic performance overhead.
</p>
<p>
See the upstream Clang documentation for more information on disabling IntSan
with <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html#disabling-instrumentation-with-attribute-no-sanitize-undefined">function
attributes</a> and <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerSpecialCaseList.html">blacklist file
formatting</a>. Blacklisting should be scoped to the particular sanitizer by
using section names specifying the target sanitizer to avoid impacting other
sanitizers.
</p>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<p>
Currently, there are no CTS test specifically for Integer Overflow Sanitization.
Instead, make sure that CTS tests pass with or without IntSan enabled to verify
that it is not impacting the device.
