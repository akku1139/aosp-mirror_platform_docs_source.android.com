  <p>This section summarizes useful tools for dynamic analysis and debugging
  from a security perspective. It covers some tools for fuzzing, sanitizing,
  and preemptively mitigating exploits. For general debugging, see
  <a href="/devices/tech/debug/">the debugging section</a>.</p>

<p>
While Android has supported fuzzing tools for many releases, Android 8.0
and later include more fuzzing support, tighter fuzzing tool integration in the
Android build system, and greater dynamic analysis support on the Android kernels.
