<p>
  Devices running Android 5.0 and later with the <code>managed_users</code> feature
  declared can be used in a <a href="http://www.android.com/work/"
  class="external">corporate environment</a> under the auspices of each companyâ€™s
  information technology (IT) department. This is possible with the introduction of
  <a href="/devices/tech/admin/multi-user">multiple users</a>,
  <a href="/devices/tech/admin/managed-profiles">managed profiles</a>, and
  enterprise mobility management (EMM) applications, as well as enhancements to default
  <a href="/security/encryption/index">encryption</a>,
  <a href="/security/verifiedboot/index">verified boot</a>, and
  <a href="/security/selinux/index">SELinux</a>.
</p>

<p>
  With these enhancements, either users or their IT departments may create
  managed profiles that separate corporate employer data from personal user
  information. Follow the documents within this section of the site to properly
  implement corporate device administration.
