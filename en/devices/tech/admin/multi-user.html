<p>Android supports multiple users on a single Android device by separating user
accounts and application data. For instance, parents may allow their children to
use the family tablet, a family can share an automobile, or a critical response team
might share a mobile device for on-call duty.</p>

<h2 id=definitions>Terminology</h2>
<p>Android uses the following terms when describing Android users and accounts.</p>

<h3 id=general_defs>General</h3>
<p>Android device administration uses the following general terms.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User</strong>. Each <em>user</em> is intended to be used by a different physical
  person. Each user has distinct application data and some unique settings, as
  well as a user interface to explicitly switch between users. A user can run in
  the background when another user is active; the system manages shutting down
  users to conserve resources when appropriate. Secondary users can be created
  either directly via the primary user interface or from a
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html">Device
  Administration</a> application.</li>

  <li><strong>Account</strong>. Accounts are contained within a user but are not defined
  by a user, nor is a user defined by or linked to any given account. Users and
  profiles contain their own unique accounts but are not required to have
  accounts to be functional. The list of accounts differs by user. For details,
  refer to the
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/Account.html">Account
  class</a> definition.</li>

  <li><strong>Profile</strong>. A profile has separated app data but shares some
  system-wide settings (for example, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). A profile is a subset
  of, and tied to, the existence of a user. A user can have multiple profiles.
  Profiles are created through a
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html">Device
  Administration</a> application. A profile always has an immutable association
  to a parent user, defined by the user that created the profile. Profiles do not
  exist beyond the lifetime of the creating user.</li>

  <li><strong>App</strong>. An application’s data exists within each associated user.
  App data is sandboxed from other applications within the same user. Apps
  within the same user can interact with each other via IPC. For details, refer
  to <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/enterprise/index.html">Building
  Apps for Work</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=user_types>User types</h3>
<p>Android device administration uses the following user types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary</strong>. First user added to a device. The primary user
  cannot be removed except by factory reset and is always running even when
  other users are in the foreground. This user also has special privileges and
  settings only it can set.</li>

  <li><strong>Secondary</strong>. Any user added to the device other than the primary
  user. Secondary users can be removed (either by themselves or by the primary
  user) and cannot impact other users on a device. These users can run in the
    background and continue to have network connectivity.</li>

  <li><strong>Guest</strong>. Temporary secondary user. Guest users have an explicit
  option to quickly delete the guest user when its usefulness is over. There can
  be only one guest user at a time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=profile_types>Profile types</h3>
<p>Android device administration uses the following profile types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Managed</strong>. Created by an application to contain work data
  and apps. They are managed exclusively by the profile owner (the app that
  created the corp profile). Launcher, notifications, and recent tasks are
  shared by the primary user and the corp profile.</li>
  <li><strong>Restricted</strong>. Uses accounts based off the primary user, who can
  control what apps are available on the restricted profile. Available only on
  tablets and television devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=applying_the_overlay>Enabling multi-user</h2>

<p>As of Android 5.0, the multi-user feature is disabled by default. To
enable the feature, device manufacturers must define a resource overlay that replaces
the following values in <code>frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml</code>:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
&lt;!--  Maximum number of supported users --&gt;
&lt;integer name="config_multiuserMaximumUsers"&gt;1&lt;/integer&gt;
&lt;!--  Whether Multiuser UI should be shown --&gt;
&lt;bool name="config_enableMultiUserUI"&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
</pre>

<p>To apply this overlay and enable guest and secondary users on the device, use
the <code>DEVICE_PACKAGE_OVERLAYS</code> feature of the Android build system to replace
the values for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>config_multiuserMaximumUsers</code> with a value greater than <code>1</code></li>
  <li><code>config_enableMultiUserUI</code> with <code>true</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Device manufacturers may decide upon the maximum number of users. If device
manufacturers or others have modified settings, they must ensure SMS and
telephony work as defined in the
<a href="/compatibility/android-cdd.pdf">Android Compatibility
Definition Document</a> (CDD).</p>

<h2 id=managing_users>Managing multiple users</h2>

<p>Management of users and profiles (with the exception of restricted profiles)
is performed by applications that programmatically invoke API in the
<code>DevicePolicyManager</code> class to restrict use.</p>

<p>Schools and enterprises may employ users and profiles to manage the lifetime
and scope of apps and data on devices, using the types outlined above in
conjunction with the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html">UserManager
API</a> to build unique solutions tailored to their use cases.</p>


<h2 id=effects>Multi-user system behavior</h2>

<p>When users are added to a device, some functionality is curtailed when
another user is in the foreground. Since app data is separated by user, the
state of those apps differs by user. For example, email destined for an account
of a user not currently in focus won’t be available until that user and account
are active on the device.</p>

<p>By default, only the primary user has full access to phone calls and texts.
The secondary user may receive inbound calls but cannot send or receive texts.
The primary user must enable these functions for others.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To enable or disable the phone and SMS
functions for a secondary user, go to <em>Settings > Users</em>, select the
user, and switch the <em>Allow phone calls and SMS</em> setting to off.</p>

<p>Some restrictions exist when a secondary user is in background. For instance,
the background secondary user cannot display the user interface or make
Bluetooth services active. In addition, the system process will halt background
secondary users if the device needs additional memory for operations in the
foreground user.</p>

<p>When employing multiple users on an Android device, keep the following
behavior in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notifications appear for all accounts of a single user at once.</li>
  <li>Notifications for other users do not appear until active.</li>
  <li>Each user gets a workspace to install and place apps.</li>
  <li>No user has access to the app data of another user.</li>
  <li>Any user can affect the installed apps for all users.</li>
  <li>The primary user can remove apps or even the entire workspace established
  by secondary users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Android 7.0 includes several enhancements, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Toggle work profile</strong>. Users can disable their managed profile
  (such as when not at work). This functionality is achieved by stopping the
  user; UserManagerService calls <code>ActivityManagerNative#stopUser()</code>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Always-on VPN</strong>. VPN applications can now be set to always-on by
  the user, Device DPC, or Managed Profile DPC (applies only to Managed Profile
  applications). When enabled, applications cannot access the public network
  (access to network resources is stopped until the VPN has connected and
  connections can be routed over it). Devices that report
  <code>device_admin</code> must implement always-on VPN.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Android Automotive Multi-User</h2>

<p>Android Automotive relies on Android’s multi-user implementation to provide a shared device
experience.</p>

<h3>Automotive User Types</h3>

<p>In addition to the user types listed above, Automotive builds are notable for these types
of users:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Headless system user.</strong> The system user hosts all system services.
   For Automotive, the system user must also be <em>headless</em>. There is only one headless user.
   A headless system user:<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Must always run in the background.</li>
        <li>Cannot be removed or accessed directly by the user. For example, users cannot switch to
          this User type to perform tasks like download apps or add accounts.</li>
        <li>Can only be cleared by a factory reset.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  <li><strong>Secondary users.</strong> The same as described above, except that secondary
    users:<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Do not run in the background and do not continue to have network connectivity.</li>
        <li>Can be created directly via the primary user interface.</li>
        <li>Have separated app data but share some system-wide settings. For example, Wi-Fi and
          Bluetooth.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>The following exceptions apply to headless, secondary, and admin users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The headless system user does not support work profiles.</li>
  <li>By default, secondary users have full access to phone calls and texts.</li>
  <li>By default, secondary users do not run in the background.</li>
  <li>By default, admin users can add and remove users and factory reset the device.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enabling the Headless System User</h3>

<p>As of Android 10, the multi-user feature can be used for automotive use-cases. Important
  distinctions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The system user is headless and runs only in the background.</li>
  <li>Human users do not interact with the system user.</li>
</ul>

<p>To enable the headless system user, device manufacturers must enable multi-user as described
  above.</p>

When the headless user is enabled:

<ul>
  <li>To declare the device to be Automotive, add the feature
    <code>android.hardware.type.automotive</code></li>
  <li>Set <code>ro.fw.multiuser.headless_system_user</code> to <code>true</code></li>
  <li>Set the value for <code>config_multiuserMaximumUsers</code> to <code>2</code>
    (or higher)</li>
</ul>
