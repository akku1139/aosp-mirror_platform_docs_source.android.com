# Testing Multiple Users

This page describes important aspects of testing multiple users on the
Android platform. For information about implementing multi-user support, see
[Supporting Multiple Users](/devices/tech/admin/multi-user).

## Device paths {: #device-paths }

The following table lists several of the device paths and how they are resolved.
All values in the **Path** column are a user-specific sandboxed storage.
Android's storage story has changed over time; read the
[Storage](/devices/storage) documentation for more information.

Note: All values in the **System path** column are translated to the
corresponding **Path** (at zygote fork time) based on what user is running the
app.

<table>
  <tr>
   <th>Path
   </th>
   <th>System path (optional)
   </th>
   <th>Purpose
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>/data/user/{userId}/{app.path}</code>
   </td>
   <td><code>/data/data</code>
   </td>
   <td>App storage
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>/storage/emulated/{userId}</code>
   </td>
   <td><code>/sdcard</code>
   </td>
   <td>Shared internal storage
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>/data/media/{userId}</code>
   </td>
   <td><em>none</em>
   </td>
   <td>User media data (for example, music, videos)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>/data/system/users/{userId}</code>
   </td>
   <td><em>none</em>
   </td>
   <td>System configuration/state per user
   <p>Accessible only by system apps</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here's an example of using a user-specific path:

```
# to access user 10's private application data for app com.bar.foo:
$ adb shell ls /data/user/10/com.bar.foo/
```

## adb interactions across users {: #adb-interactions-across-users }

Several `adb` commands are useful when dealing with multiple users. Some of
these commands are supported only in Android {{ androidPVersionNumber }} and
higher:

*   `adb shell instrument --user <userId>` runs an instrumentation test against
    a specific user. By default this uses the current user.
*   `adb install --user <userId>` installs a package for a specific user. To
    guarantee that a package is installed for all users, you must call this for every
    user.
*   `adb uninstall --user <userId>` uninstalls a package for a specific user.
    Call without the `--user` flag to uninstall for all users.
*   `adb shell am get-current-user` gets the current (foreground) user ID.
*   `adb shell pm list users` gets a list of all existing users.
*   `adb shell pm create-user` creates a new user, returning the ID.
*   `adb shell pm remove-user` removes a specific user by ID.
*   `adb shell pm disable --user <userId>` disables a package for a specific
    user.
*   `adb shell pm enable --user <userId>` enables a package for a specific user.
*   `adb shell pm list packages --user <userId>` lists packages (`-e` for
    enabled, `-d` for disabled) for a specific user. By default this always lists for
    the system user.

The following information helps explain how `adb` behaves with multiple users:

*   `adb` (or more accurately the `adbd` daemon) always runs as the **system
    user** (user ID = 0) _regardless of which user is current_. Therefore device
    paths that are user dependent (such as `/sdcard/`) always resolve as
    the system user. See [Device paths](#device-paths) for more details.

*   If a default user isn't specified, each `adb` subcommand has a different user. The
    best practice is to retrieve the user ID with `am get-current-user` and then
    explicitly use `--user <userId>` for any command that supports it. Explicit
    user flags weren't supported for all commands until Android {{
    androidPVersionNumber }}.

*   Access to `/sdcard` paths of secondary users is denied starting in
    Android {{ androidPVersionNumber }}. See
    [Content provider for multi-user data](#content-provider) for details on how
    to retrieve files during testing.

## Content provider for multi-user data {: #content-provider }

Because `adb` runs as the system user and data is sandboxed in Android {{
androidPVersionNumber }} and higher, you must use content providers to push or
pull any test data from a nonsystem user. This is **not** necessary if:

*   `adbd` is running as root (through `adb root`), which is only possible using
    `userdebug` or `usereng` builds.

*   You're using Trade Federation's (Tradefed's)
    [`ITestDevice`](/reference/tradefed/com/android/tradefed/device/ITestDevice)
    to push/pull the files, in which case use `/sdcard/` paths in your test
    config (for example, see the source code for `pushFile` in
    [`NativeDevice.java`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/tradefederation/+/master/src/com/android/tradefed/device/NativeDevice.java)).

When a content provider is running in the secondary user, you can access it by
using the `adb shell content` command with the appropriate `user`, `uri`, and
other parameters specified.

### Workaround for app developers {: #workaround-for-app-developers }

Interact with test files using `adb content` and an instance of
[`ContentProvider`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics),
instead of the `push` or `pull` command.

1.  Create an instance of `ContentProvider` hosted by the app that can serve/store files
    where needed. Use the appâ€™s internal storage.
1.  Use `adb shell content` `read` or `write` commands to push/pull the files.

### Workaround for media files {: #workaround-for-media-files }

To push media files to the media partition of the SD card, use [`MediaStore`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore) public
APIs. For example:

```
# push MVIMG_20190129_142956.jpg to /storage/emulated/10/Pictures
# step 1
$ adb shell content insert --user 10 --uri content://media/external/images/media/ --bind _display_name:s:foo.jpg

# step 2
$ adb shell content query --user 10 --projection _id --uri content://media/external/images/media/ --where "_display_name=\'foo.jpg\'"

# step 3
$ adb shell content write --user 10 --uri content://media/external/images/media/8022 < MVIMG_20190129_142956.jpg
```

### Installing a generic content provider {: #install-a-generic-content-provider }

Install and use an existing content provider that reads and writes files to the
user-specific `/sdcard` path.

Get `TradefedContentProvider.apk` in one of these ways:

*   Download the
    [`TradefedContentProvider.apk` file](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/tradefederation/+/refs/heads/master/res/apks/contentprovider/TradefedContentProvider.apk) from the Android Git Repository

*   Or build it from the source using `make TradefedContentProvider`.

    ```
    # install content provider apk
    $ adb install --user 10 -g TradefedContentProvider.apk

    # pull some_file.txt
    $ adb shell content read --user 10 --uri content://android.tradefed.contentprovider/sdcard/some_file.txt > local_file.txt

    # push local_file.txt
    $ adb shell content write --user 10 --uri content://android.tradefed.contentprovider/sdcard/some_file.txt < local_file.txt
    ```

## Trade Federation multi-user support {: #tradefed }

[Tradefed](/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed) is the official
Android test harness. This section summarizes some of Tradefed's builtin support
for multi-user test scenarios.

### Status checkers {: #tradefed-statuscheckers }

[System status checkers (SSCs)](/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed/testing/through-suite/system-status-checker)
are run **before** the target preparers, and their cleanup is run **after**
those preparers.

[`UserChecker`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/tradefederation/+/refs/heads/master/src/com/android/tradefed/suite/checker/UserChecker.java)
is defined explicitly to aid developers when testing multiple users. It tracks
whether a test has changed the state of the users on the device (for example,
created users without removing them in teardown). In addition, if `user-cleanup`
is set, it automatically attempts to clean up after the test, while still
providing helpful errors so that the test can be fixed.

```
<system_checker class="com.android.tradefed.suite.checker.UserChecker" >
    <option name="user-cleanup" value="true" />
</system_checker>
```

### Target preparer {: #tradefed-targetpreparer }

Target preparers are typically used to set up a device with a particular
configuration. In the case of multi-user testing preparers can be used to create users of a
specific type as well as switch to other users.

For device types that don't have a secondary user, you can use
`CreateUserPreparer` to create _and switch_ to a secondary user in
`AndroidTest.xml`. At the end of the test, the preparer switches back and
deletes the secondary user.

```
<target_preparer
  class="com.google.android.tradefed.targetprep.CreateUserPreparer" >
</target_preparer>
```

If the user type you want already exists on the device, use
`SwitchUserTargetPreparer` to switch to the existing user. Common values for
`user-type` include `system` or `secondary`.

```
<target_preparer
  class="com.android.tradefed.targetprep.SwitchUserTargetPreparer">
    <option name="user-type" value="secondary" />
</target_preparer>
```

### Host-driven tests {: #tradefed-hostdriven }

In some instances, a test needs to switch users _within the test_. Don't
make the switch from within a device-side test framework, such as
[UI Automator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-automator),
because the test process may be killed at any time. Instead, use a host-side test framework like Tradefed's
[Host-Driven Test Framework](/preview/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed/testing/through-tf/host-driven-test),
which gives access to
[`ITestDevice`](/reference/tradefed/com/android/tradefed/device/ITestDevice),
allowing for any user manipulation that is needed.

Use `UserChecker` (described in
[Status checkers](#tradefed-statuscheckers)) for host-driven tests that change
the user state because it ensures that the test properly cleans up after itself.
