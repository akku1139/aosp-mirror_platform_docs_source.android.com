# Configure an Android Device

Android provides various ways to get more out of the operating system with
measures available for different device specifications and purposes. The pages
within this tab of the site walk you through potential customizations.

## ART and Dalvik
[Android runtime (ART)](/devices/tech/dalvik) is the managed runtime used by
applications and some system services on Android. ART and its predecessor Dalvik
are compatible runtimes created specifically for the Android project.

## Data usage
Android helps users understand and control how their devices
[use network data](/devices/tech/datausage). It monitors overall data usage and
supports warning or limit thresholds that trigger notifications or disable
mobile data when usage exceeds a specific quota.

## Enterprise device administration
Devices running Android 5.0 and later with the managed_users feature declared
can be used in a corporate [enterprise environment](/devices/tech/admin) under
the auspices of each companyâ€™s information technology (IT) department.

## Performance and health
Take advantage of the many [performance and health](/devices/tech/health) tests
and tools for optimizing Android.

## Permission
Android offers numerous mechanisms for granting necessary
[permissions](/devices/tech/config/perms-whitelist) only, such as the privileged
permission whitelist for implementors to explicitly whitelist privileged apps.

## Power use
[Power/battery use](/devices/tech/power) information is derived from battery use
statistics and power profile values. Android includes myriad measures for
controlling power use, such as application power management and support for
batteryless devices.

## Updates
Android devices in the field can receive and install
[over-the-air (OTA)](/devices/tech/ota/) updates to the system, application
software, and time zone rules. OTA updates upgrade the underlying operating
system and its read-only apps.
