<p>
  Trade Federation is distributed with the AOSP and uses the Android build system
  to create its binary. Make sure you've <a href="/setup/initializing.html"
  >established a build environment</a> to compile and run packages from the
  Android source tree.
</p>

<h2>Build Tradefed</h2>

<p>
  From the root directory of the Android source tree:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">source ./build/make/envsetup.sh</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">lunch &lt;device-target&gt;</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">make tradefed-all -j8</code>
</pre>

<p>
  See <a href="/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed/development/index.md">Developing Tradefed</a>
  for more details about how to set up your environment for coding in Tradefed.
</p>

<h2>Download Tradefed</h2>

<p>
  You can download already built Tradefed packages ready to use from the
  <a href="https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp-master/grid">Continuous Integration
  Dashboard</a>
  in the <b>test_suites_x86_64</b> column; look for the <b>tradefed.zip</b> file in the
  <b>Build Artifacts</b> tab.
</p>

<p>
  Once unzipped, you can simply invoke <code>./tradefed.sh</code> directly from the unzipped
  directory.
</p>

<h2>Run from command line</h2>

<p>
  Tradefed requires the <code>adb</code> utility in your <code>$PATH</code>:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
export PATH=$PATH:&lt;path/to/adb&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  If Tradefed was built, the <code>tradefed.sh</code> launcher script is
  accessible from your path. To launch the
  <a href="/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed/fundamentals/console">Trade Federation Console</a>:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
tradefed.sh
</pre>
<p>
  Now your environment is set up for Trade Federation.
