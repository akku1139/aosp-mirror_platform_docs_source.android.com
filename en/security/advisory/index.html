<p>Android Security Advisories are a supplement to the
<a href="{@docRoot}security/bulletin/index.html">Android Security Bulletins</a>.
Android publishes advisories to address issues that may not require security patches
or Nexus/Pixel device updates but could still affect an Android user’s overall
security. Android Security Bulletins are accompanied by
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">factory device images</a>
and over-the-air (OTA) device updates to protect users against known
security issues in the Android ecosystem. Android Security Advisories are meant
to provide users detailed information and guidance on Android-related
security issues potentially <em>without</em> an accompanying software update.</p>

<p>However, when updates are available to address issues described in an Android
Security Advisory, those updates will be made available in an Android Security
Bulletin for Nexus and Pixel devices. In the Android Security Bulletin, we will
reference the Android Security Advisories that the bulletin addresses.</p>

<p>As with the bulletins, join the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-security-updates">Android Security Updates</a>
group to receive a notification when we publish an advisory.</p>
