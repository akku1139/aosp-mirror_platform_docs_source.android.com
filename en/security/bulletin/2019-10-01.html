<p><em>Published October 7, 2019 | Updated October 8, 2019</em></p>

<p>The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2019-10-06 or later address
all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705">Check & update
your Android version</a>.</p>

<p>Android partners are notified of all issues in the 2019-10-01 and 2019-10-05 patch levels
at least a month before publication. Android partners were notified of all issues in the
2019-10-06 patch level within the last month. Source code patches for these issues will be
released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository in the next 48 hours. We will
revise this bulletin with the AOSP links when they are available.</p>

<p>The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in the
Media framework component that could enable a remote attacker using a specially
crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged
process. The <a
href="/security/overview/updates-resources.html#severity">severity
assessment</a> is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability
would possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.
</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="#mitigations">Android
and Google Play Protect mitigations</a> section for details on the <a
href="/security/enhancements/index.html">Android
security platform protections</a> and Google Play Protect, which improve the
security of the Android platform.</p>

<aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> Information on the latest over-the-air update
(OTA) and firmware images for Google devices is available in the
<a href="/security/bulletin/pixel/2019-10-01">October 2019 Pixel Update
Bulletin</a>.</aside>

<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>

<p>Android 10 introduces Google Play system updates (<a
href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/fresher-os-with-projects-treble-and-mainline.html">Project
Mainline</a>) which expedites how updates can be delivered to Android
devices with Google Mobile Services. The Android Security Bulletin identifies
security issues which are remediated through Google Play system updates. Please
see <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en">this
article</a> for more details on how to install security updates.</p>

<h2 id="mitigations">Android and Google service mitigations</h2>

<p>This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the <a
href="/security/enhancements/index.html">Android
security platform</a> and service protections such as <a
href="https://www.android.com/play-protect">Google Play Protect</a>. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
to update to the latest version of Android where possible.</li>
<li>The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through <a
href="https://www.android.com/play-protect">Google Play Protect</a> and
warns users about <a
href="/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf">Potentially
Harmful Applications</a>. Google Play Protect is enabled by default on
devices with <a href="http://www.android.com/gms">Google Mobile
Services</a>, and is especially important for users who install apps from
outside of Google Play.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2019-10-01-details">2019-10-01 security patch level vulnerability
details</h2>

<p>In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2019-10-01 patch level. Vulnerabilities are
grouped under the component that they affect. Issues are described in the tables
below and include CVE ID, associated references, <a
href="#type">type of vulnerability</a>, <a
href="/security/overview/updates-resources.html#severity">severity</a>,
and updated AOSP versions (where applicable).  When available, we link the
public change that addressed the issue to the bug ID, like the AOSP change list.
When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional references are linked
to numbers following the bug ID. Devices with Android 10 and later may receive
security updates as well as <a
href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en">Google Play
system updates</a>.</p>

<h2 id="common-questions-and-answers">Common questions and answers</h2>

<p>This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these
issues?</strong></p>
<p>To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices"
class="external">Check and update your Android version</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security patch levels of 2019-10-01 or later address all issues associated
    with the 2019-10-01 security patch level.</li>
  <li>Security patch levels of 2019-10-05 or later address all issues associated
    with the 2019-10-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.</li>
  <li>Security patch levels of 2019-10-06 or later address all issues associated
    with the 2019-10-06 security patch level and all previous patch levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2019-10-01]</li>
  <li>[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2019-10-05]</li>
  <li>[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2019-10-06]</li>
</ul>

<p>For some devices on Android 10 or later, the Google Play system update will
have a date string that matches the 2019-10-01 security patch level.
Please see <a
href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en"
class="external">this article</a> for more details on how to install
security updates.</p>

<p><strong>2. Why does this bulletin have three security patch
levels?</strong></p>

<p>This bulletin has three security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Devices that use the 2019-10-01 security patch level must include all
    issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
    issues reported in previous security bulletins.</li>
  <li>Devices that use the security patch level of 2019-10-05 or newer must
    include all issues associated with that security patch level, the 2019-10-01
    security patch level, as well as fixes for all issues reported in previous
    security bulletins.</li>
  <li>Devices that use the security patch level of 2019-10-06 or newer must
    include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
    bulletins.</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are
addressing in a single update.</p>
