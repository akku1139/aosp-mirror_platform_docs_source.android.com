<strong>4. What does a * next to the Android bug ID in the <em>References</em>
column mean?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Issues that are not publicly available have a * next to the Android bug ID in
the <em>References</em> column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Pixel&hairsp;/&hairsp;Nexus devices available
from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/drivers"
class="external">Google Developer site</a>.

are required to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities, such as those documented in this
bulletin are not required for declaring a security patch level.
