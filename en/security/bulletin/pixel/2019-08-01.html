<p><em>Published August 5, 2019 | Updated August 13, 2019</em></p>

<p>The Pixel  Update Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities and
functional improvements affecting <a
href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices"
class="external">supported
Pixel devices</a> (Google devices).
For Google devices, security patch levels of 2019-08-01 or later address, at a
minimum, all issues in this bulletin and all issues associated with the
2019-08-01 security patch level in the August 2019 Android Security Bulletin. To
learn how to check a device's security patch level, see <a
href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705"
class="external">Check and update your Android version</a>.</p>

<p>All supported Google devices will receive an update to the 2019-08-01 patch
level. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> The Google device firmware images are available on the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images" class="external">Google
Developer site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>

<p>In addition to the 2019-08-01 security patch level
security vulnerabilities described in the August 2019
Android Security Bulletin, Google devices contain patches
for the security vulnerabilities described below.
Partners were notified of these issues at least a month
ago and may choose to incorporate them as part of their
device updates.</p>

<h2 id="security-patches">Security patches</h2>

<p>Vulnerabilities are grouped under the component that they affect. There is a
description of the issue and a table with the CVE, associated references, <a
href="#type">type
of vulnerability</a>, <a
href="/security/overview/updates-resources#severity">severity</a>,
and updated Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions (where applicable). When
available, we link the public change that addressed the issue to the bug ID,
like the AOSP change list. When multiple changes relate to a single bug,
additional references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.</p>

</p>
<p>
Issues that are not publicly available have an * next to the Android bug ID in
the <em>References</em> column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Pixel devices available
from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/drivers"

are required to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities, such as those documented in this
bulletin are not required for declaring a security patch level.
