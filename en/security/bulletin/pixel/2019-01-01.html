vulnerabilities described below. Partners were notified of these issues at
least a month ago and may choose to incorporate them as part of their device
updates.
</p>

<h2 id="security-patches">Security patches</h2>
<p>
Vulnerabilities are grouped under the component they affect. There is a
description of the issue and a table with the CVE, associated references,
<a href="#type">type of vulnerability</a>,
<a href="/security/overview/updates-resources#severity">severity</a>,
and updated Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions (where applicable).
When available, we link the public change that addressed the issue to the bug
ID, such as the AOSP change list. When multiple changes relate to a single bug,
additional references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.
