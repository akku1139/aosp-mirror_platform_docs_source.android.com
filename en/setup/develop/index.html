<p>
  Working with Android code requires using <strong>Git</strong> (an open-source
  version control system) and <strong>Repo</strong> (a Google-built repository
  management tool that runs on top of Git). See <a href="/setup/create/coding-tasks">Common Source Control Tasks</a>
  for a summary of regular actions, such as uploading changes for review.
</p>

<h2 id="git">Git</h2>

<p>
  Git is designed to handle large projects that are distributed over multiple
  repositories. Android uses Git for local operations such as local branching,
  commits, diffs, and edits. One of the challenges in setting up the Android
  project was figuring out how to best support the outside community&mdash;from
  the hobbyist community to large OEMs building mass-market consumer devices. We
  wanted components to be replaceable, and we wanted interesting components to
  have a life of their own outside of Android. We first chose a distributed
  revision control system, then narrowed it down to Git.
</p>

<p>
  For more details on Git, refer to
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/documentation" class="external">Git
  Documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="repo">Repo</h2>
<p>
  Repo unifies Git repositories when necessary, performs uploads to the
  <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/" class="external">Gerrit revision control
  system</a>, and automates parts of the Android development workflow. Repo comes in two parts:
  The <strong>Repo Launcher</strong> you download from <em>git-repo-downloads</em> is the first
  part. It is a Python script that knows how to initialize a checkout and download the second part,
  the full <strong>Repo</strong> tool. The full Repo tool is by default in
  <code>$SRCDIR/.repo/repo/...</code> and receives forwarded commands from the downloaded Repo
  Launcher.
</p>

<p>
  Repo isn't meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git in the
  context of Android. The <code>repo</code> command is an executable Python script that you
  can put anywhere in your path. In working with the Android source files, you
  use Repo for across-network operations. For example, with a single Repo
  working directory.
</p>

<p>
  In most situations, you can use Git instead of Repo, or mix Repo and Git
  commands to form complex commands. However, using Repo for basic
  across-network operations makes your work much simpler. For more details
  on Repo, see the <a href="/setup/develop/repo">Repo Command Reference</a> and
  <a href="https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/refs/heads/master/README.md">Repo README</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="other-tools">Other tools</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/" class="external">Gerrit</a> is
  a web-based code review system for projects that use Git. Gerrit encourages
  more centralized use of Git by allowing all authorized users to submit
  changes, which are automatically merged if they pass code review. In addition,
  Gerrit makes reviewing easier by displaying changes side by side in the
  browser and enabling inline comments.
