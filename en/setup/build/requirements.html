<p>
  Before you download and build the Android source, ensure that your system meets
  the following requirements, then see <a href="/setup/build/initializing">Establishing
  a Build Environment</a> for installation instructions by operating system.
</p>

<h2 id=hardware-requirements>Hardware requirements</h2>
<p>
  Your development workstation should meet or exceed these hardware
  requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 64-bit environment is required for Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread) and
    higher versions, including the master branch. You can compile older versions
    on 32-bit systems.
  </li>
  <li>At least 250GB of free disk space to check out the code and an extra 150&nbsp;GB
    to build it. If you conduct multiple builds, you need additional space.
    <aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you're checking out a mirror,
      you need more space as full Android Open Source Project (AOSP) mirrors
      contain all Git repositories that have ever been used.</aside>
  </li>
  <li>If you're running Linux in a virtual machine, you need at
    least 16&nbsp;GB of RAM/swap.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id=software-requirements>Software requirements</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/" class="external">AOSP</a>
  <code>master</code> branch is traditionally
  developed and tested on Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, but other
  distributions may be used. See
  <a href="/setup/build/initializing">Establishing a Build Environment</a> for
  additional required packages and the commands to install them.</p>
<p>
  Your workstation must have the software listed below.
  These requirements apply to the AOSP <code>master</code> branch. For Android
  versions 8.0 (Oreo or O) through 5.0 (Lollipop or L), consider using the included
  <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/master/tools/docker" class="external">Dockerfile</a>
  to ease installation of all required packages. For the manual method, see
  <a href="/setup/build/older-versions">Supporting Older Versions</a>.
</p>

<h3 id=os>OS</h3>
<p>
  If you're developing against the AOSP <code>master</code> branch, use either
  Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) or the latest versions of macOS and Xcode with command line tools
  installed.
</p>

<h3 id=jdk>JDK</h3>
<p>
  The <code>master</code> branch of Android in AOSP comes with a prebuilt version of OpenJDK, so no
  additional installation is required.
</p>

<p>Older versions of Android require a separate installation of the JDK. On Ubuntu, use OpenJDK.</p>

<h3 id=packages>Key packages</h3>
<p>
  The AOSP master branch comes with a prebuilt version of Make, so no additional installation is
  required. Git is similarly installed as part of the  <a href="/setup/build/initializing">Establishing
  a Build Environment</a> process.</p>

<p>Finally, ensure your system has <a href="http://www.python.org/download/" class="external">Python 2.7</a>.</p>

<h3 id=binaries>Device binaries</h3>
<p>Download previews, factory images, drivers, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and
other blobs below. For details, see
  <a href="/setup/build/downloading#obtaining-proprietary-binaries">Obtaining proprietary
  binaries</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/android/blobs-preview" class="external">Preview
    binaries (blobs)</a> for AOSP <code>master</code> branch development
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images" class="external">Factory
    images</a> for supported devices running tagged AOSP release branches
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/android/drivers" class="external">Binary
    hardware support files</a> for devices running tagged AOSP release
    branches
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id=toolchain>Build toolchain</h3>
<p>
  Android 8.0 and higher support only
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain.html#working_with_clang" class="external">Clang/LLVM</a>
  for building the Android platform. Join the
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-llvm" class="external">android-llvm</a>
  group to pose questions and get help. Report NDK/compiler issues at the
  <a href="https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk" class="external">NDK GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
  For the
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/index.html" class="external">Native
  Development Kit (NDK)</a> and legacy kernels, GCC 4.9 included in the AOSP
  <code>master</code> branch (under <code>prebuilts/</code>) may also be used.
