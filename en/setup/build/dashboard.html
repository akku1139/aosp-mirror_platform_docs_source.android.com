<p>The
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" class="external">continuous
    integration</a> dashboard (<a href="https://ci.android.com/" class="external">ci.android.com</a>)
    provides visibility into the system used by the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).</p>

<p>Contributors to AOSP can use this dashboard to monitor when their submissions are integrated
  into the tree. The status color shows whether the integrated change has built successfully
  across all of our build types. For convenience, the build artifacts
  from each build are available for download.</p>

<p>Each row represents a build that is completed on
  Android's automated builders. Each column represents a build target/buildtype combination.
  Within the grid, in-progress and completed builds are shown. In-progress builds are color-coded
  with a yellow background, failed builds with a red background, and successful builds with a green
  background. When a build is completed you can download the build artifacts by clicking the
  <span class="material-icons">get_app</span>(<strong>View artifacts</strong>) icon, which links to
  a page where the artifacts can be downloaded. Selecting a square opens a panel at the bottom of
  the screen with tabs for "Details" where the logs are kept, "Changes" which lists what changes
  went into a build, and another link to the build artifacts. The dashboard refreshes automatically
  as new builds are completed.</p>

<p>The dashboard can be found at <a href="https://ci.android.com"
                                    class="external">ci.android.com</a></p>
