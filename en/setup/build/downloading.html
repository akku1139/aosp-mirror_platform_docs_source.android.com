<p>
  The Android source tree is located in a Git repository hosted by Google. The
  Git repository includes metadata for the Android source, including
  changes to the source and when the changes were made. This page
  describes how to download the source tree for a specific Android code-line.
</p>

  Installing Repo
</h2>
<p>
  <a href="/setup/develop#repo">Repo</a> is a tool that makes it easier to work with Git in the
  context of Android. For more information about Repo, see the
  <a href="/setup/develop/repo">Repo Command Reference</a> and
  <a href="https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/refs/heads/master/README.md">Repo README</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Repo comes in two parts: One is a launcher script you install, and it communicates with the second
  part, the full Repo tool included in a source code checkout. To install Repo:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make sure that you have a <code>bin/</code> directory in your home directory
      and that it's included in your path:
    </p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">mkdir ~/bin</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">PATH=~/bin:$PATH</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Download the Repo Launcher and ensure that it's executable:
    </p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo &gt; ~/bin/repo</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">chmod a+x ~/bin/repo</code>
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  For version 1.25, the SHA-256 checksum for Repo is
  <code>d06f33115aea44e583c8669375b35aad397176a411de3461897444d247b6c220</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For version 1.26, the SHA-256 checksum for Repo is
  <code>0cf5f52bcafb8e1d3ba0271b087312f6117b824af272bedd4ee969d52363a86b</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="initializing-a-repo-client">
  Initializing a Repo client
</h2>
<p>
  After installing the Repo Launcher, set up your client to access the Android source
  repository:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create an empty directory to hold your working files. If you're using
      macOS, this has to be on a case-sensitive filesystem. Give it any name you
      like:
    </p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">mkdir <var>WORKING_DIRECTORY</var></code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">cd <var>WORKING_DIRECTORY</var></code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Configure Git with your real name and email address. To use the Gerrit
      code-review tool, you need an email address that's connected with a <a href=
      "https://www.google.com/accounts" class="external">registered Google account</a>. Make sure
      that this is a live address where you can receive messages. The name that
      you provide here shows up in attributions for your code submissions.
    </p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Run <code>repo init</code> to get the latest version of Repo with
      its most recent bug fixes. You must specify a URL for the manifest,
      which specifies where the various repositories included in the Android
      source are placed within your working directory.
    </p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest
</pre>
    <p>
      To check out a branch other than <em>master</em>, specify it with <code>-b</code>.
      For a list of branches, see <a href="/setup/start/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds">
      Source code tags and builds</a>.
    </p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.0.1_r1
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  A successful initialization ends with a message stating that Repo is
  initialized in your working directory. Your client directory should now
  contain a <code>.repo</code> directory where files such as the manifest
  are kept.
</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-files">
  Downloading the Android source tree
</h2>
<p>
  To download the Android source tree to your working directory from the
  repositories as specified in the default manifest, run:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">repo sync</pre>
<p>
  The Android source files are located in your working directory under their
  project names. To speed syncs, use the <code>-j<var>threadcount</var></code> flag. Also consider
  adding <code>-qc</code> to conduct quiet, current branch syncs only.
  See the <a href="/setup/develop/repo">Repo Command Reference</a> for more details.
</p>
<h2 id="using-authentication">
  Using authentication
</h2>
<p>
  By default, access to the Android source code is anonymous. To protect the
  servers against excessive use, each IP address is associated with a quota.
</p>
<p>
  When sharing an IP address with other users (for example, when accessing the source
  repositories from beyond a NAT firewall), the quotas can trigger even for
  regular use patterns (for example, if many users sync new clients from the same IP
  address within a short period).
</p>
<p>
  In that case, you can use authenticated access, which then uses a
  separate quota for each user, regardless of the IP address.
</p>
<p>
  The first step is to create a password with <a href=
  "https://android.googlesource.com/new-password" class="external">the password generator</a>
  and follow the instructions on the password generator page.
</p>
<p>
  The second step is to force authenticated access by using the
  manifest URI <code>https://android.googlesource.com/a/platform/manifest</code>.
  Notice how the <code>/a/</code> directory prefix triggers mandatory
  authentication. You can convert an existing client to use mandatory
  authentication with the following command:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/a/platform/manifest
</pre>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-network-issues">
  Troubleshooting network issues
</h2>
<p>
  When downloading from behind a proxy (which is common in some corporate
  environments), you might need to to explicitly specify the proxy that is
  then used by Repo:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">export HTTP_PROXY=http://&lt;proxy_user_id&gt;:&lt;proxy_password&gt;@&lt;proxy_server&gt;:&lt;proxy_port&gt;</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">export HTTPS_PROXY=http://&lt;proxy_user_id&gt;:&lt;proxy_password&gt;@&lt;proxy_server&gt;:&lt;proxy_port&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  More rarely, Linux clients experience connectivity issues, getting stuck in
  the middle of downloads (typically during <em>receiving objects</em>). It's been
  reported that tweaking the settings of the TCP/IP stack and using non-parallel
  commands can improve the situation. You need root access to modify the TCP
  setting:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling=0</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">repo sync -j1</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="using-a-local-mirror">
  Using a local mirror
</h2>
<p>
  When using several clients, especially in situations where bandwidth is
  scarce, it's better to create a local mirror of the entire server content,
  and to sync clients from that mirror (which requires no network access). The
  download for a full mirror is smaller than the download of two clients, while
  containing more information.
</p>
<p>
  These instructions assume that the mirror is created in
  <code>/usr/local/aosp/mirror</code>. First, create and sync the
  mirror itself. Notice the <code>--mirror</code> flag, which you can specify
  only when creating a new client:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">mkdir -p /usr/local/aosp/mirror</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">cd /usr/local/aosp/mirror</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/mirror/manifest --mirror</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">repo sync</code>
</pre>
<p>
  When the mirror is synced, you can create new clients from it. Note that it's
  important to specify an absolute path:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">mkdir -p /usr/local/aosp/master</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">cd /usr/local/aosp/master</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">repo init -u /usr/local/aosp/mirror/platform/manifest.git</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">repo sync</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Finally, to sync a client against the server, sync the mirror
  against the server, then the client against the mirror:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">cd /usr/local/aosp/mirror</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">repo sync</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">cd /usr/local/aosp/master</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">repo sync</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It's possible to store the mirror on a LAN server and to access it over NFS,
  SSH, or Git. It's also possible to store it on a removable drive and to pass
  that drive among users or machines.

<h2 id="obtaining-proprietary-binaries">Obtain proprietary binaries</h2>

<p>AOSP can't be used from pure source code only and requires additional
hardware-related proprietary libraries to run, such as for hardware
graphics acceleration. See the sections below for download links and <a
href="/setup/build/requirements#binaries">Device binaries</a> for additional
resources.</p>

<aside class ="note">Some devices package these proprietary binaries on their
<code>/vendor</code> partition.</aside>

<h3 id="downloading-proprietary-binaries">Download proprietary binaries</h3>

<p>You can download official binaries for the supported devices running tagged
AOSP release branches from <a
href="https://developers.google.com/android/drivers" class="external">Google's
drivers</a>. These binaries add access to additional hardware capabilities
with non-open source code. To build the AOSP master branch, use the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/blobs-preview" class="external">
Binaries Preview</a> instead. When building the master branch for a device, use
the binaries for the <a href="/setup/start/build-numbers">most recent
numbered release</a> or with the most recent date.</p>

<h3 id="extracting-proprietary-binaries">Extract proprietary binaries</h3>

<p>Each set of binaries comes as a self-extracting script in a compressed
archive. Uncompress each archive, run the included self-extracting script from
the root of the source tree, then confirm you agree to the terms of the enclosed
license agreement. The binaries and their matching makefiles will be installed
in the <code>vendor/</code> hierarchy of the source tree.</p>

<h3 id="cleaning-up">Clean up</h3>

<p>To ensure the newly installed binaries are properly taken into account after
being extracted, delete the existing output of any previous build using:</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
