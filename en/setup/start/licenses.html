<p>
  The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) uses a few
  <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" class="external">open source
  initiative</a> approved open source licenses for our software.
</p>
<h2 id="android-open-source-project-license">AOSP license</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" class="external">Apache
  License, Version 2.0</a> (Apache 2.0) is the preferred license for AOSP,
  and the majority of Android software is licensed with Apache 2.0.
  While the project strives to adhere to the preferred license, there are
  exceptions, which are handled on a case-by-case basis. For example,
  the Linux kernel patches are under the
  GPLv2 license with system exceptions, which can be found on
  <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/COPYING" class="external">kernel.org</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="contributor-license-grants">Contributor license agreements</h2>
<p>All <em>individual</em> contributors (those making contributions only on
  their own behalf) of ideas, code, or documentation to AOSP are required to
  complete, sign, and submit an
  <a href="https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual" class="external">Individual
  Contributor License Agreement</a>. The agreement can be executed online
  through the
  <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/settings/agreements" class="external">code
  review tool</a>. The agreement clearly defines the terms for contributing
  intellectual property to AOSP. This license is for your
  protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the project; it doesn't
  change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
  A <a href="https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate" class="external">Corporate
  Contributor License Agreement</a> is available for a <em>corporation</em>
  (or other entity) with employees working on AOSP. This version of the agreement
  allows a corporation to authorize contributions submitted by its designated
  employees and to grant copyright and patent licenses. </p>
<aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> A Corporate Contributor
  License Agreement doesn't remove the need for a developer to sign their own
  Individual Contributor License Agreement as an individual. The individual
  agreement is needed to cover any of their contributions that are <em>not</em>
  owned by the corporation signing the Corporate Contributor License Agreement.</aside>
<p>
  We based our agreements on those used by the
  <a href="http://www.apache.org" class="external">Apache Software Foundation</a>, which can
  be found on the
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/" class="external">Apache website</a>.

<h2 id="why-apache-software-license">Why Apache Software License?</h2>
<p>
  For userspace (non-kernel) software, we prefer Apache 2.0
  (and similar licenses such as BSD and MIT) over other licenses such as
  the Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Here's why.
</p>
<p>
  Android is about freedom and choice. The purpose of Android is to promote
  openness in the mobile world, and we can't predict or
  dictate all the uses for our software. So, while
  we encourage everyone to make open and modifiable devices, we don't
  think it's our place to force them to do so. Using LGPL libraries could
  be restrictive. Here are some of our specific concerns:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In simplified terms, LGPL requires shipping of source to the
    application; a written offer for source; or linking the LGPL-ed library
    dynamically and allowing users to manually upgrade or replace the library.
    Android software is typically shipped as a static system
    image, so complying with these requirements restricts device manufacturer designs. For
    instance, it's difficult for a user to replace a library on read-only
    flash storage.
  </li>
  <li>
    LGPL requires the allowance of customer modification and reverse
    engineering for debugging those modifications. Most device makers don't
    want to be bound by these terms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Historically, LGPL libraries have been the source of many
    compliance problems for downstream device makers and application
    developers. Educating engineers on these issues is difficult and
    time consuming. It's critical to Android's success that
    device makers can easily comply with the licenses.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The issues discussed above are our reasons for preferring Apache 2.0 for
  our code. They aren't criticisms of LGPL or other licenses.
  We appreciate all free and open source licenses, and respect others' license
  preferences. We've simply decided that Apache 2.0 is right for our goals.
