# Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} Release Notes

This page summarizes the major features in the
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} release, and provides links to additional
information. These feature summaries are organized according to the feature's
documentation location on this site.

## Build

### java_sdk_library

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces
[`java_sdk_library`](/devices/architecture/java-library), a new build rule to
fix compatibility issues for shared Java libraries. Device manufacturers can
use this mechanism for their own shared Java libraries to maintain backward
compatibility for their APIs.


## Architecture

### Modular system components

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} [modularizes some Android system
components](/devices/architecture/modular-system/) and enables them to be
updated outside of the normal Android release cycle. Some modules include:

  * [Android Runtime](/devices/architecture/modular-system/runtime)
  * [Conscrypt](/devices/architecture/modular-system/conscrypt)
  * [DNS Resolver](/devices/architecture/modular-system/dns-resolver)
  * [DocumentsUI](/devices/architecture/modular-system/documentsui)
  * [ExtServices](/devices/architecture/modular-system/extservices)
  * [Media](/devices/architecture/modular-system/media)
  * [ModuleMetadata](/devices/architecture/modular-system/metadata)
  * [Networking](/devices/architecture/modular-system/networking)
  * [PermissionController](/devices/architecture/modular-system/permissioncontroller)
  * [Time Zone Data](/devices/architecture/modular-system/timezone)

### Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds support for HALs to
[shut down automatically](/devices/architecture/hal/dynamic-lifecycle#automatic-lifecycles)
when they have no clients.

### Kernel

#### ABI

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes support for new
[ABI monitoring utilities](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/build/+/refs/heads/master/abi/){: .external}
to help with comparing, tracking, and mitigating kernel ABI changes that affect
compatibility with kernel modules.

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} also introduces a symbol-based
[ABI usages checker](/devices/architecture/vndk/abi-use-check.md). The checker
can detect outdated prebuilt binaries at build time, so that shared library
developers can know which prebuilt binaries might be broken by their change and
which prebuilt binaries must be rebuilt.


#### Android Live-Lock Daemon

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes the
[Android Live-Lock Daemon (llkd)](/devices/architecture/kernel/config#llkd),
which is designed to catch and mitigate kernel deadlocks.

#### vDSO32 on ARM64

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} supports using
[vDSO32 on 64-bit kernels](/devices/architecture/kernel/config#vdso32-on-arm64),
which provides a 0.4 percent increase in battery life and other performance
improvements.

#### fstab entries for early mounted partitions

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} requires devices to specify `fstab` entries
for
[early mounted partitions](/devices/architecture/kernel/mounting-partitions-early)
using an `fstab` file in the first stage ramdisk.

### HIDL

#### Offload BroadcastQueue

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes a new _offload_ `BroadcastQueue`
to the existing _background_ and _foreground_ queues. The offload queue has
the same priority and timeout behavior as the background queue. To prevent
blocking the background queue, where more interesting or user-visible
broadcasts can happen, the offload queue handles the `BOOT_COMPLETED`
broadcast, which many apps listen to and can take a long time to complete.
The offload queue currently only handles the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast, but
can potentially handle other long broadcasts.

#### SystemSuspend service

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} replaces the thread in `libsuspend`
responsible for initiating system suspend with the
[SystemSuspend HIDL service](/devices/architecture/systemsuspend). This
implementation offers equivalent functionality to previous versions while
leveraging benefits from the Android HIDL infrastructure.

#### safe_union in HIDL

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces
[`safe_union`](/devices/architecture/hidl/safe_union), an explicitly tagged
union type, in HIDL.

### Configuration

#### ConfigStore HAL
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} deprecates the
[ConfigStore HAL](/devices/architecture/configuration) due to high memory
consumption and difficult usage, and replaces the HAL with
[system properties](/devices/architecture/sysprops-apis).

#### Config File Schema API

The Android platform contains a large number of XML files for storing config
data. Many of the XML files are in the `vendor` partition, but they're read in
the `system` partition. In this case, the schema of the XML file serves as the
interface across the two partitions, and therefore the schema must be
explicitly specified and must evolve in a backward-compatible manner. Before
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the platform didnâ€™t provide mechanisms to
require specifying and using the XML schema, or to prevent incompatible changes
in the schema. Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides this mechanism,
called the
[Config File Schema API](/devices/architecture/config-file-schema-api).

#### System properties as APIs

[System properties](/devices/architecture/sysprops-apis) accessed across
partitions are schematized into `sysprop` description files, and APIs to access
properties are generated as concrete functions for C++ and classes for Java.

### Vendor interface (VINTF) object

#### VINTF

Changes to VINTF in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} include:

 * Deprecating AVB version tags
 * Adding kernel information in OTA packages
 * Building ODM manifests officially
 * Adding a product compatibility matrix
 * Associating a
 [manifest entry with a HAL module](/devices/architecture/vintf/objects#manifest-fragments)
 in the build system


### Bootloader

#### Ramdisk

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the
[root file system](/devices/bootloader/system-as-root#ramdisk) is no longer
included in `ramdisk.img` and is instead merged into `system.img`.

#### Building ODM partitions

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes support for
[building `odm` partitions](/devices/bootloader/odm-partitions) using the
Android build system. You can use a separate `/odm` partition for
customizations, which enables you to use a single vendor image for multiple
hardware SKUs. This enables original design manufacturers (ODMs) to customize
system-on-chip (SoC) vendor board-support packages (BSPs) to their specific
devices (their boards). They can implement kernel modules for board-specific
components, board-specific daemons, or their own features on hardware
abstraction layers (HALs). They may also replace or customize SoC components.

#### Boot image header versioning

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} updates the
[boot image header](/devices/bootloader/boot-image-header) to version 2, which
includes a section to store the device tree blob (DTB) image. Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} VTS tests verify that all devices launching with
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} use boot image header version 2 and include
a valid DTB image as part of the boot/recovery images.

#### Recovery images for non-A/B devices

In Android 9 and higher, a device's [recovery image must contain information
from the overlay image](/devices/bootloader/recovery-image#acpio-implementation).
Device manufacturers can use DeviceTree or Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface (ACPI) to describe all nondiscoverable devices. Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} and higher includes support for architectures that
use ACPI instead of DeviceTree blob for overlay (DTBO).

#### Stable AIDL

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds support for stable
[Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL)](/devices/bootloader/stable-aidl),
a new way to keep track of the application program interface (API)/application
binary interface (ABI) provided by AIDL interfaces.

#### Moving fastboot to user space

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds support for resizable partitions by
relocating the [fastboot implementation](/devices/bootloader/fastbootd) from
bootloader to user space.

## Display

### HDR video playback

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} supports
[HDR10, VP9, and HDR10+ playback](/devices/tech/display/hdr).


### Text classification

[Text classification](/devices/tech/display/textclassifier) uses machine
learning techniques to help developers classify text. Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces two methods to the TextClassifier API:
[`suggestConversationActions`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/textclassifier/TextClassifier#suggestConversationActions(android.view.textclassifier.ConversationActions.Request)){: .external}
and [`detectLanguage`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/textclassifier/TextClassifier#detectLanguage(android.view.textclassifier.TextLanguage.Request)){: .external}.
The `suggestConversationActions` method generates suggested replies and actions
from a given conversation and the `detectLanguage` method detects the language
of the text.

### Support for Zawgyi font rendering

Zawgyi is the most popular font in Myanmar. Android 9 and lower didn't support
rendering Zawgyi because it
[isn't Unicode compliant](https://www.unicode.org/faq/myanmar.html){: .external}.
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} addresses this by including a Unicode font
capable of rendering both Unicode Burmese and Zawgyi together. No implementation
work is needed to support Zawgyi font rendering on devices launching with
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}. If your devices have a custom
implementation to support Zawgyi, you can:

 *  Revert those changes and use the platform-supported method.
 *  Keep the common Zawgyi font in your system and use the locale code
 `my-qaag` in your `fonts.xml`. For more information, see the
 [Unicode CLDR release notes on Zawgyi (Qaag)](http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#unicode_script_subtag_validity){: .external}.


### Limitations to hiding app icons

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} limits the ability to hide app icons in the
launcher. Apps must have an icon unless any of the following is true:

 * It's a system app, even if it's been updated.
 * It's a managed profile admin (work profile owner).
 * It requests no permissions.
 * It contains no components (such as, activities, content providers, broadcast
 receivers, and services).

Apps that have an enabled launchable activity with an icon aren't affected.
Aside from the exceptions listed above, all apps display an icon. If no
icon is included, a default system icon is displayed. App icons with no
launchable activity open the app info screen when tapped.

## Settings

To improve accessibility, Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes
user-customizable timeout settings. The API and Settings changes come with
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}. If you customize your Settings, make sure
that this feature is supported. If you have UI elements that time out on your
device, use the
[timeouts API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityManager#getRecommendedTimeoutMillis(int,%2520int)){: .external}
on those. For more information, see the
[Android developer accessibility guidelines](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility){: .external}.


## Compatibility

### Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD)

The [Android 10 Compatibility Definition Document](/compatibility/android-cdd)
iterates upon [previous versions](/compatibility/cdd) with updates for new
features and changes to requirements for previously released functionality.


## Tests


### Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)

Android CTS has a separate
[release notes page](/compatibility/cts/cts-release-notes) that lists many
important changes for Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}.

#### CTS downloads

CTS packages supporting Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} are available on the
[CTS Downloads](/compatibility/cts/downloads) page. The source code for the
included tests can be synced with the `android-cts-10_r1` tag in the
open-source tree.

#### CTS shim APEX

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces a package called `CtsShimApex`,
which must be preinstalled on a device to write CTS tests for APEX management.

#### Test harness mode

[CTS test harness mode](/compatibility/cts/harness) helps developers automate
testing for a device or a fleet of devices.

#### Instant Apps mode

Starting in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, CTS runs in
[Instant Apps mode](/compatibility/cts/cts-instant), which means installing the
test APK as an Instant App and running the tests.

In addition to a CTS mode for Instant Apps, Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}
includes [CTS Verifier for Instant Apps](/compatibility/cts/verifier-instant-apps)

#### CTS Verifier pro audio test

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds a CTS Verifier test for
[Pro Audio compliance](/compatibility/cts/Verifier-Pro-Audio).

#### CTS Verifier MIDI tests

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the
[CTS Verifier MIDI test](/compatibility/cts/cts-midi) tests MIDI functionality
with USB MIDI interfaces, Bluetooth MIDI interfaces, and a virtual MIDI device
path.
#### CTS test interpretation

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} updates the mechanism for
[interpreting CTS results](/compatibility/cts/interpret).

### Vendor Test Suite (VTS)

#### VTS testing with debug ramdisk

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the generic system image (GSI) used to
run CTS-on-GSI/VTS compliance testing changes from userdebug to user build type,
because GSI is release signed. However, the `adb root` command that gives a host
root permissions to the Android device under test isn't available in a user
build. This is a problem because VTS requires `adb root` to run.

The [debug ramdisk](/compatibility/vts/vts-on-gsi) is introduced to make
`adb root` possible, if the device is unlocked. This simplifies the testing
flow by reusing the same user build `system.img` (either GSI or the OEMâ€™s
`system.img`).

#### Hardware Composer validation

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds a new VTS test class for Hardware
Composer validation through the `readback` interface in
[`IComposerClient.hal`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/master/graphics/composer/2.2/IComposerClient.hal){: .external}.
If vendors don't implement `readback`, tests pass automatically.


### Debugging

#### Loading shared libraries with different class loaders

In Android 9 and lower, apps loaded their linked Java shared libraries in the
app's class loader. In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the framework uses
a different class loader than the app's class loader to load Java shared
libraries linked through `uses-library` or `uses-static-library`.

In general, apps shouldn't rely on using a specific class loader, so this
change shouldn't break app behavior. However, if an app relies on using a
single class loader, that behavior is broken. Additionally, package-private
visibility of classes in the same package is still supported, but isn't
supported in shared libraries.

Device manufacturers might see app compatibility issues as they test their
devices running Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}.



## Security features

### Face authentication

[Face authentication](/security/biometric/face-authentication) allows users to
unlock their device simply by looking at the front of their device.
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds support for a new face authentication
stack that can securely process camera frames, preserving security and privacy
during face authentication on supported hardware. Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} also provides an easy way for security-compliant
implementations to enable app integration for transactions such as
online banking or other services.

### Extended access

Trust agents, the underlying mechanism used by tertiary authentication
mechanisms such as Smart Lock, can only extend unlock in Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }}. Trust agents can no longer unlock a locked device
and can only keep a device unlocked for a maximum of four hours.

### Encryption

#### OEMCrypto

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} uses OEMCrypto API version 15.


### Testing

#### BoundsSanitizer

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} deploys
[BoundsSanitizer (BoundSan)](/devices/tech/debug/bounds-sanitizer) in Bluetooth
and codecs. BoundSan uses UBSan's bounds sanitizer. This mitigation is enabled
on a per-module level. It helps keep critical components of Android secure and
shouldn't be disabled. BoundSan is enabled in the following codecs:

 * `libFLAC`
 * `libavcdec`
 * `libavcenc`
 * `libhevcdec`
 * `libmpeg2`
 * `libopus`
 * `libvpx`
 * `libspeexresampler`
 * `libvorbisidec`
 * `libaac`
 * `libxaac`

#### Integer Overflow Sanitization

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} enables
[Integer Overflow Sanitization (IntSan)](/devices/tech/debug/intsan) in
software codecs. Ensure that playback performance is acceptable for any codecs
that aren't supported in the device's hardware. IntSan is enabled in the
following codecs:

 * `libFLAC`
 * `libavcdec`
 * `libavcenc`
 * `libhevcdec`
 * `libmpeg2`
 * `libopus`
 * `libvpx`
 * `libspeexresampler`
 * `libvorbisidec`

#### Execute-only memory

By default, executable code sections for AArch64 system binaries are marked
execute-only (nonreadable) as a hardening mitigation against just-in-time code
reuse attacks. Code that mixes data and code together and code that purposefully
inspects these sections (without first remapping the memory segments as
readable) no longer functions. Apps with a target SDK of Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} (API level 29 or higher) are impacted if the app
attempts to read code sections of
[execute-only memory (XOM)](/devices/tech/debug/execute-only-memory) enabled
system libraries in memory without first marking the section as readable.

#### Scudo

[Scudo](/devices/tech/debug/scudo) is a dynamic user-mode memory allocator
designed to be more resilient against heap-related vulnerabilities. It provides
the standard C allocation and deallocation primitives, as well as the C++
primitives.

#### ShadowCallStack

[`ShadowCallStack` (SCS)](/devices/tech/debug/shadow-call-stack) is an
[LLVM instrumentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ShadowCallStack.html){: .external}
mode that protects against return address overwrites (like stack buffer
overflows) by saving a function's return address to a separately allocated
`ShadowCallStack` instance in the function prolog of nonleaf functions and
loading the return address from the `ShadowCallStack` instance in the function
epilog.

## Audio

### Audio HAL

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes the following new capatibilties
for [audio HAL](/devices/audio/implement).

 * `AudioSource`
 * `AudioFormat`
 * `AudioChannelMask`

Additional requirements are added for audio HAL and subsystem implementation.

### Preprocessing effects

Android provides
[preprocessing effects](/devices/audio/implement-pre-processing), such as
acoustic echo cancellation, automatic gain control, and noise suppression.
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes new requirements for capturing with
`VOICE_COMMUNICATION`.

### Audio policy manager

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes a significant refactoring of the
[audio policy manager](/devices/audio/implement-policy) to provide more
flexibility to support complex automotive use cases.

### High-resolution audio

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes the following improvements for
[high-resoluton audio](/devices/audio/highres-effects).

 * Float support
 * 192&nbsp;KHz frequency support
 * Eight-channel support
 * Inclusion of timing information

### Concurrent capture

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} improves the
[concurrent capture](/devices/audio/concurrent) user experience that requires
more than one active audio capture to happen simultaneously.

### AudioPlaybackCapture

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} contains a new API called
`AudioPlaybackCapture`, which gives apps the ability to copy the audio being
played by other apps. This feature is similar to screen capture, but for audio.
The primary use case is to enable streaming apps to capture the audio being
played by games.

The capture API doesn't affect the latency of the app whose audio is being
captured.

### MIDI

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} makes it easier to port professional audio
apps using MIDI to the Android platform using the
[`AMidi` NDK API](/devices/audio/midi#midi-ndk).

## Camera

For a summary of the changes to the camera API, camera HAL, and camera module
introduced in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, see
[Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} camera updates](/devices/camera/versioning#100).

### Camera framework privacy improvements

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces privacy enhancements to the
camera framework. To avoid exposing potentially sensitive static camera
information in
[`CameraCharacteristics`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics){: .external}
without user consent, apps must obtain the
[`CAMERA`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#CAMERA){: .external}
permission to retrieve static metadata with a privacy-sensitive tag using the
[`getCameraCharacteristics`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraManager#getCameraCharacteristics(java.lang.String)){: .external}
method.

To get a list of the camera characteristic keys that require the `CAMERA`
permission, call the
[`getKeysNeedingPermission`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics.java#303){: .external}
method.


### Session reconfiguration query
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds a
[session reconfiguration query](/devices/camera/session-parameters#session_reconfiguration_query)
feature, which allows for improved performance through more control over the
internal session parameter reconfiguration logic.

### Camera HAL3 buffer management APIs

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces optional
[camera HAL3 buffer management APIs](/devices/camera/buffer-management-api) that
allow you to implement buffer management logic to achieve different memory and
capture latency tradeoffs in camera HAL implementations.

### Camera HAL dynamic physical camera switch

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces a dynamic metadata tag,
`ANDROID_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA_ACTIVE_PHYSICAL_ID`,
which indicates the active underlying physical camera of a logical camera
device. For more information, see
[Multi-Camera Support](/devices/camera/multi-camera#support_checklist).

### Support for hiding physical cameras

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the camera HAL can reduce the number of
physical cameras that can be directly opened by an app. For more
details, see [Multi-Camera Support](/devices/camera/multi-camera#support_checklist).

### Camera2 VNDK API

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, vendor modules can access and control
camera devices through two new standard HIDL interfaces,
`android.frameworks.cameraservice.service@2.0` and
`android.frameworks.cameraservice.device@2.0`. To make using the HIDL
interfaces more convenient, Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} also introduces
a vendor-available library, `libcamera2_vendor`. This library is similar to the
[Camera NDK library](https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/camera){: .external},
with a few minor modifications.

### Stream configurations

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds features that allow camera vendors to
advertise
[recommended camera streams](/devices/camera/stream-config#recommended_stream_configurations)
to camera clients and to support an
[API to query stream combinations](/devices/camera/stream-config#api_to_query_stream_combinations).


### Camera stream combination requirements

Devices running Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} are no longer required to
support stream combinations with physical subcamera streams. However, devices
running Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} with the camera HAL device version
3.5 must support `isStreamCombinationSupported()` to allow apps to query
whether a stream combination containing physical streams is supported.

For more information, see
[Multi-Camera Support](/devices/camera/multi-camera#support_checklist).

### HEIF imaging

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides native camera support for
[high efficiency image file format (HEIF) images](/devices/camera/heif), which
offer improved image quality and smaller sizes over JPEG images. Devices must
have an HEIC or HEVC encoder to support HEIF images.

### Monochrome cameras

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides additional support for the Y8
stream format, monochrome and near-infrared (NIR) color filter array static
metadata, and `DngCreator` functions for
[monochrome cameras](/devices/camera/monochrome).

## Connectivity

### Calling and messaging


#### Emergency numbers and emergency calling

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides improved support for
[emergency calling](/devices/tech/connect/emergency-call). In an emergency,
devices with support for IRadio HAL v1.4 can initiate an emergency call using
emergency numbers retrieved from a source such as a SIM card, the network
signal, or the Android database. Numbers can be categorized based on emergency
service categories such as police, fire, and ambulance.

#### Group call APIs

The group call APIs are an extension of the eMBMS APIs added in Android 9. The
new APIs define a standard for apps to join and broadcast on cell-broadcast
group calls by interacting with eMBMS middleware packages. Group calls require
support from the chipset vendor, middleware vendor, and the cell carrier to
function properly. Developer documentation is located at
[developer.google.com](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/MbmsGroupCallSession){: .external}.

#### Remote SIM capabilities

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces remote SIM capabilities that
allow messaging apps on an Android host device to send SMS messages through
phones using mechanisms such as Bluetooth. For more information, see the
reference documentation for the
[`getSubscriptionType`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SubscriptionInfo.html#getSubscriptionType()){: .external}
method and the
[`SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE_REMOTE_SIM`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SubscriptionManager.html#SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE_REMOTE_SIM){: .external}
constant.

#### Multiple eSIMs

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, the `EuiccManager` class supports
devices with
[multiple embedded SIMs (eSIMs)](/devices/tech/connect/esim-overview#supporting_multiple_esims),
or eUICCs.

#### eSIM updates

For devices running Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} that support eSIMs, a
nonremovable eUICC slot ID array must be defined. Devices must also support
IRadio HAL v1.4 and IRadioConfig HAL v1.2. For more information, see
[Implementing eSIM](/devices/tech/connect/esim-overview#hardwaremodem_requirements)
and [Modem Requirements](/devices/tech/connect/esim-modem-requirements#hal_requirements).

#### 5G Non-Standalone (NSA)

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds support for
[5G non-standalone (NSA)](/devices/tech/connect/5g-nsa). 5G NSA is a solution
for 5G networks where the network is supported by an existing 4G infrastructure.
On Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, devices can display a 5G icon on the
status bar when a device connects to a 5G network.

#### Phone account suggestion

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces the
[phone account suggestion service](/devices/tech/connect/phone-account-suggestion),
which allows suggestions for phone accounts to be shown to users when making a call.

### Carrier

#### Migrating Mobile Network settings

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} rearchitected the Mobile Network settings
UI code and moved it from the Telephony stack to the Settings stack. To support
the migrated code, change the following Mobile Network settings configuration
values from Android resources to `CarrierConfig` resources:

`config_world_mode` -&gt;
`CarrierConfigManager#KEY_WORLD_MODE_ENABLED_BOOL`

`config_support_tdscdma` -&gt;
`CarrierConfigManager#KEY_SUPPORT_TDSCDMA_BOOL`

`config_support_tdscdma_roaming_on_networks` -&gt; 
`CarrierConfigManager#KEY_SUPPORT_TDSCDMA_ROAMING_NETWORKS_STRING_ARRAY`

`config_enabled_lte` -&gt; 
`CarrierConfigManager#KEY_LTE_ENABLED_BOOL`

#### Device identifiers

Persistent [device identifiers](/devices/tech/config/device-identifiers)
(IMEI/MEID, IMSI, and build serial) are guarded by a privileged permission
with access also granted to device and profile owner apps. Because the IMSI and
SIM serial number are carrier provided, access to these identifiers is
granted to packages with carrier privileges.

### Wi-Fi

#### Network selection

Android continuously evaluates the quality of the connected network and
assesses the quality of available networks. Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} has updated algorithms and procedures for
[selecting and switching between Wi-Fi networks](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-network-selection).

#### Wi-Fi preferred network offload scanning

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces an optional API method named
`setDeviceMobilityState()` in `WifiManager` that increases the interval between
[preferred network offload (PNO)](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-scan)
scans when the device is stationary to reduce power usage.

#### Carrier Wi-Fi

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, devices with the
[carrier Wi-Fi feature](/devices/tech/connect/carrier-wifi) automatically
connect to configured carrier Wi-Fi networks (networks with public key
certificates).

#### Wi-Fi Easy Connect

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, devices can use
[Wi-Fi Easy Connect](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-easy-connect), which uses the
device provisioning protocol (DPP) introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA), to
provision and configure Wi-Fi devices.

#### Wi-Fi low-latency mode

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces a
[Wi-Fi low-latency mode](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-low-latency), which
configures the Wi-Fi chip to reduce latency.

#### Updated DHCP server

As part of the formation of an "IP Server" service umbrella, `dnsmasq` is
being deleted. Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} replaces its DHCPv4 server
functional use with a separate component, primarily written in Java to better
integrate with the Java framework control plane. This improves security and
updatability for the DHCP server. For more details, see
[`packages/modules/NetworkStack/src/android/net/dhcp/DhcpServer.java`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/NetworkStack/+/refs/heads/master/src/android/net/dhcp/DhcpServer.java){: .external}.

No action is required to implement this change: all devices releasing and
upgrading to Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} use `DhcpServer` by default.
If you have customizations to the DHCP server, you can revert to Android 9
behavior by setting the global setting `tether_enable_legacy_dhcp_server=1`.
The new `DhcpServer` is included in the networking components module, so any
customization to DHCP server functionality should be upstreamed.

#### WPA3 and Wi-Fi Enhanced Open

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds support for the [Wi-Fi Protected
Access 3 (WPA3) and Wi-Fi Enhanced Open](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-wpa3-owe)
security standards to provide better privacy and robustness against known
attacks.

#### Wi-Fi Direct

[Wi-Fi Direct](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-direct), also known as Wi-Fi P2P,
allows supporting devices to discover and connect to one another directly using
the Wi-Fi Direct protocol without internet or cellular network access.

#### MAC randomization enhancements

From Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }},
[MAC randomization](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-mac-randomization) is enabled by
default for client mode, SoftAp, and Wi-Fi Direct. Devices must provide an
option to enable or disable MAC randomization for each SSID in the system UI.

#### Passpoint R2

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces support for
[Passpoint R2 features](/devices/tech/connect/wifi-passpoint#passpoint_r2).
Passpoint R2 implements online sign up (OSU), a standard method to provision
new Passpoint profiles. Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} supports the
provisioning of EAP-TTLS profiles using SOAP-XML.

### NFC

#### Secure NFC

[Secure NFC](/devices/tech/connect/secure-nfc) allows off-host NFC card
emulation to be enabled only when the device's screen is unlocked. Implementing
this feature gives users the option to enable Secure NFC for improved security.

#### Android Beam deprecated

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, Android Beam is no longer required and
the following interfaces and methods have been deprecated.

## Graphics

### ASurfaceControl

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds
[`ASurfaceControl`](/devices/graphics/arch-sf-hwc#surfaceflinger), a new way for
`SurfaceFlinger` to accept buffers.

### Graphics implementation

#### OpenGL ES layers

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces a
[layering system](/devices/graphics/implement-opengl-es#gles_layers) for GLES.

#### EGL 1.5

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} implements the
[EGL 1.5 interface](https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/specs/eglspec.1.5.pdf){: .external}.
For information on new features in EGL 1.5, view the
[Khronos Releases EGL 1.5 Specification](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-egl-1.5-specification){: .external}.

#### Vulkan

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes support for Vulkan 1.1 graphics.
The platform also supports `VK_KHR_swapchain` v70, so the Vulkan app is able
to create a `VkImage` backed by swapchain memory.

#### Performance refresh rate

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} adds support for a performance refresh rate.
This feature is turned off by default.

## Interaction

### Automotive

#### Automotive audio

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, Audio HAL context maps to
`AudioAttributes.usage` to identify sounds. Android supports one
`AUDIO_DEVICE_OUT_BUS` instance per context. `IAudioControl` HAL provides
[vehicle-specific extensions to the Audio HAL](/devices/automotive/audio).

### Gestural navigation

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces an option for a fully gestural
system navigation. For information about how to prepare apps to use this
feature, see the
[Gestural navigation](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/gesturalnav){: .external}
page on the Android Developer site.

### Neural networks

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces updates to the Neural Networks
API and the Neural Networks HAL. For a summary of the changes, see
[Neural networks](/devices/neural-networks/#android-q).

New and updated Neural Networks documentation for Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }}:

* [Overview](/devices/neural-networks/)
* [AHardwareBuffer](/devices/neural-networks/ahardwarebuffer)
* [Burst Executions and Fast Message Queues](/devices/neural-networks/burst-executions)
* [Compilation Caching](/devices/neural-networks/compilation-caching)
* [Device Discovery and Assignment](/devices/neural-networks/device-discovery)
* [Vendor Extensions](/devices/neural-networks/vendor-extensions)

### Sensors

#### Sensors HAL 2.0

[Sensors HAL 2.0](/devices/sensors/sensors-hal2) supports using
[fast message queues (FMQs)](/devices/architecture/hidl/fmq) to send sensor
events from the HAL into the Android Sensors Framework.

#### Sensors Off

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes a developer setting to
[shut off all sensors](/devices/sensors/sensors-off) on a device. This feature
helps developers test their appâ€™s functionality in situations where those
sensors become unavailable, and also gives users a way to control the sensors
in their device.

If your devices use the default implementation of `SensorService`,
`CameraService`, and `AudioPolicyService`, then no additional customization is
needed to the reference design. If you have other sensors, see
[Customization](/devices/sensors/sensors-off#customization) for more details
about supporting this feature.

## Media

### Updatable media components

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides
[updatable media components](/devices/media/updatable-media) that enable
updating media-related
[modular system components](/devices/architecture/modular-system/) through the
Google Play Store infrastructure or through a partner-provided over-the-air
(OTA) mechanism.

### Media DRM

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} improves the utility and usability of the
`MediaDrm` Java and NDK APIs.

### Decoding

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} supports AV1 SW decoding.

## Permissions

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides additional permission
configurations for transparency and user privacy.

### Contacts provider and affinities information

Starting in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, contacts-affinity-related
data, managed by the
[Contacts Provider component](/devices/tech/config/contacts-affinities), is
accessed differently than in Android 9 and lower. These changes regarding data
accessibility improve user privacy in all Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} devices that use the Contacts Provider component.
The underlying database no longer contains contact affinities data. Therefore
apps canâ€™t write to or read from it.

The changes in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} are expected to have a large
impact on APIs. If your apps rely on the deprecated features mentioned in
Contacts Provider and Affinities Information, you may want to update your apps
to compensate for any changes. Additionally, if you use a forked version of the
Contacts Provider, you must update your Contacts Provider.


### Tristate location permissions

[Tristate location permissions](/devices/tech/config/tristate-perms) in Android
{{ androidQVersionNumber }} give users more control over how apps access their
device locations.

### Background location access reminder
Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} features a
[background access location reminder](/devices/tech/config/background-location-access),
which increases transparency into how much access apps have to a device's
location and helps users maintain control over such access.


### Restrict opportunistic locations

When an app requests a deviceâ€™s location, the app can either wait for the request
response or, by using active location listeners, get an opportunistic location
update. Starting in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, to get
[opportunistic location updates](/devices/tech/config/restrict-opportunistic-locations),
developers must specify that they need passive location updates from the
`FusedLocationProviderClient` class.

### Background apps launching

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, nonprivileged apps without a visible
window canâ€™t launch themselves automatically to the foreground. This change
suppresses ad popups and malicious takeovers. No action is required to enable
this.

### App sandboxing

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, apps have a limited raw view of the
file system, with no direct access to paths like `/sdcard/DCIM`. However, apps
retain full raw access to their package-specific paths, as returned by any
applicable methods such as
[`Context.getExternalFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getExternalFilesDir(java.lang.String)){: .external}.
Apps still have full raw access to their package-specific paths.

Use the app sandbox
[guidelines for sharing files](/security/app-sandbox#guidelines-for-sharing-files)
to provide appropriate data-sharing granularity.


### Restrict app clipboard access

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, clipboard access has changed so that
clipboard content canâ€™t be watched by calling
[`ClipboardManager.getPrimaryClip`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ClipboardManager.html#getPrimaryClip()){: .external}
or by adding an
[`onPrimaryClipChanged`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener){: .external}
listener for notification when the clipboard changes. This increases user
privacy and disables malvertizing apps from modifying the clipboard.

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, read access is only allowed to either
the current app with input focus, or to the current keyboard. The
[`ClipboardManager.onPrimaryClipChanged()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener#public-methods_1){: .external}
listener call now only fires for apps that meet such restrictions.
[`ClipboardManager.getPrimaryClip`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ClipboardManager.html#getPrimaryClip()){: .external}
and [`ClipboardManager.getPrimaryClipDescription`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ClipboardManager.html#getPrimaryClipDescription()){: .external}
return `null` if the requesting app either isnâ€™t the default input method
editor (IME), or doesnâ€™t have input focus.


### Runtime permissions include activity recognition

Users now see an activity recognition dialog when an app accesses device
location in the background. Hard-restricted runtime permissions must be
properly whitelisted in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}.

### MANAGE_DEVICE_ADMINS permission

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} changes the
[`MANAGE_DEVICE_ADMINS`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/res/AndroidManifest.xml){: .external}
permission from signature or privileged to signature only. This means that only
platform-signed apps can set other apps as a device admin.

### Sharing API improvements

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides a number of
[new Android Platform API features related to sharing](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/sharing){: .external}.
If you've modified the Share Sheet code in your implementation, ensure that
your implementation supports these new features. If you haven't modified the
Share Sheet code in your implementation, you donâ€™t need to do anything to
support these new features.


## Android Runtime (ART)

### Signed Config

The [Signed Config](/devices/tech/dalvik/signed-config) feature allows
embedding configuration of non-SDK interface restrictions in APKs. This enables
removing specific non-SDK interfaces from the blacklist, so that AndroidX can
safely use them. With this change, AndroidX can add support for new features
on older Android versions.


## Performance


### Cgroup abstraction layer

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} includes a
[cgroup abstraction layer](/devices/tech/perf/cgroups) and task profiles, which
developers can use to describe a set of restrictions to apply to a thread or a
process.

### Low Memory Killer Daemon (lmkd)

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} supports a new
[`lmkd` mode](/devices/tech/perf/lmkd) that uses kernel pressure stall
information (PSI) monitors for memory pressure detection.

## Power

### Platform power management

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }},
[Doze mode](/devices/tech/power/platform_mgmt)
can be enabled on always-on devices as well as on battery-powered devices.

### Routine battery saver

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces a new battery saver schedule
option called **based on routine**.
[Routine battery saver](/devices/tech/power/routine-battery-saver) allows an
app chosen by the OEM to provide signals to the system for more intelligent
battery saver scheduling. This option requires configuration, and is optional
to implement.

### Power stats HAL

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }},
[`IPowerStats.hal`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/master/power/stats/1.0/IPowerStats.hal){: .external}
replaces the power stats collection APIs in
[`IPower.hal`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/interfaces/+/master/power/1.3/IPower.hal){: .external}.
While the power HAL still supports the APIs, they'll be migrated exclusively to
the power stats HAL in the future.

The power stats HAL includes new APIs to support the collection of data from
on-device power measurement, for supported devices. The existing power stats
collection APIs are also updated to improve flexibility. The power hinting
APIs remain in power HAL and aren't changing.


### Thermal mitigation

The thermal framework in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} abstracts device
interfaces for the thermal subsystem temperature sensor, including CPU, GPU,
battery, skin, and cooling device. The framework introduces a polling interface
to query thermal status to initiate throttling, and a callback interface to
send a message to the user when a threshold is exceeded.

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} provides the new data types through the
`IThermalService` interface using these three new methods:



 * [`getCurrentThermalStatus()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager#getCurrentThermalStatus()){: .external}
  returns the current thermal status of the device as an integer, unless the
  device is undergoing throttling.
 * [`addThermalStatusListener()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager#addThermalStatusListener(android.os.PowerManager.OnThermalStatusChangedListener)){: .external}
  adds a listener.
 * [`removeThermalStatusListener()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager#removeThermalStatusListener(android.os.PowerManager.OnThermalStatusChangedListener)){: .external}
   removes a previously added listener.

Apps add and remove listeners and access temperature status in the
[`PowerManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager){: .external}
class. Only a trusted system service such as an Android API or device
manufacturer API can access information about associated causal events. Device
manufacturers or SoC makers must implement `thermal HAL 2.0` to enable the full
functionality of the new thermal framework.

For a thermal mitigation implementation example, see the
[Reference implementation](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/google/pixel/+/refs/heads/master/thermal/){: .external}.


## Updates

### APEX file format

[Android Pony EXpress (APEX)](/devices/tech/ota/apex) is a new container format
used in the install flow for modular system components.

### Dynamic partitions

[Dynamic partitions](/devices/tech/ota/dynamic_partitions) introduce a
userspace partitioning system to Android, allowing partitions to be created,
resized, or destroyed during OTA updates. Device makers don't have to worry
about the individual sizes of partitions, such as `system`, `vendor`, and
`product`. Instead, one big `super` partition is allocated, and subpartitions
can be sized dynamically within it.

### Dynamic system updates

[Dynamic system updates (DSU)](/devices/tech/ota/dynamic-system-updates) allows
you to make an Android system image that users can download from the internet
and try out without the risk of corrupting the current system image.

### Multiuser backup and restore

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} supports
[backup and restore](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/backup/package-summary){: .external}
functionality for all users on a device. Previously, backup and restore was
only available for the system user. Backup and restore for nonsystem users is
turned off by default as it has only partial coverage for settings, wallpaper,
and system components.

### Overlayfs

Users working with `userdebug` or `eng` builds expect to be able to efficiently
remount the system partition as read-write and then add or modify any number of
files without reflashing the system image. You can use `Overlayfs`, which
automatically sets up backing storage for a writable file system as an upper
reference, and mounts over the lower. These actions happen in the
`adb disable-verity` and `adb remount` requests. For more details, see the
[Overlayfs README](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/a9a3b73163fda5abf237cc0f0cee97ff33e6254d/fs_mgr/README.overlayfs.md){: .external}
in AOSP.

### Shared library support in recovery mode

In Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}, shared libraries are available in the
recovery partition, which eliminates the need for all recovery mode executables
to be static. The shared libraries are located under the
`/system/lib` (or `/system/lib64` for 64-bit devices) directory in the
partition.

To add a new shared library to the recovery partition, add
`recovery_available: true` or `recovery: true` to `Android.bp` of the shared
library. The former installs the library to both the system and recovery
partitions, while the latter installs it only to the recovery partition.

Shared library support can't be built with Android's make-based build system.
To convert an existing static executable for the recovery mode to a dynamic one,
remove `LOCAL_FORCE_STATIC_EXECUTABLE := true` in `Android.mk` or
`static_executable: true` (in `Android.bp`).

### User Data Checkpoint (UDC)

Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }} introduces the
[User Data Checkpoint (UDC) feature](/devices/tech/ota/user-data-checkpoint),
which allows Android to roll back to its previous state when an Android
over-the-air (OTA) update fails.
