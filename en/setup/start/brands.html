<p>
  The Android name, the Android logo, the Google Play brand, and other
  Google trademarks are the property of Google LLC and are not
  part of the assets available through the Android Open Source Project.
</p>

<p>If you want to use these brands to indicate their association with your
  device or service, adhere to the guidelines on this page. All creatives that
  include or reference Android or Google trademarks must be reviewed and fully
  approved by the Android brand team. Use the
  <a href="https://support.google.com/contact/partner_brand_approval" class="external">brand
  request form</a> to submit your marketing for review.
</p>

<p>These guidelines correspond to and complement the marketing materials on
the <a href="https://partnermarketinghub.withgoogle.com/" class="external">Partner
Marketing Hub</a> and
<a href="https://www.google.com/permissions/" class="external">Google Brand
Permissions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="brand-android">Android</h2>

<p>
  The use of Android on a hardware device and packaging or marketing
  materials related to that hardware device is restricted to
  <a href="/compatibility/index">Android compatible</a> devices only. The
  following are guidelines for the Android brand and related assets that can be
  used for compatible devices. For detailed guidance, see the
  <a href="https://partnermarketinghub.withgoogle.com/" class="external">Partner
  Marketing Hub</a>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android&trade; should have a trademark symbol the first time it appears in
  a creative.</li>
  <li>Android should always be capitalized and is never plural or possessive.
  </li>
  <li>Android should never be used in the name of your product or as the
  primary or dominant mark on your packaging or device.</li>
  <li>Android should be used only as a term to refer to the operating system
  (OS) of your device. If you're unsure whether your use meets our guidelines,
  follow this simple test: If you can replace “Android“ with “the Android
  platform“ and the text still makes sense, then you may use this term.
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color:red">Incorrect:</span> Android XBrand Phone</li>
    <li><span style="color:green">Correct:</span> XBrand phone on Android</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You may use “with Android” in plain black text with your logo. If used
  with your logo, “with Android“ should be no larger than 90% of your logo’s
  size. The first or most prominent instance of this use should be followed by
  a &trade; symbol.</li>
  <li>Android may be used <em>only as a descriptor</em>, as long as it is
  followed by a proper generic term. It can't be framed as the product name or
  brand of your device.
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color:red">Incorrect:</span> Android XBrand Phone</li>
    <li><span style="color:green">Correct:</span> Android mobile device</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Google reserves the right to require Android and/or Google branding on
    compatible devices and any related materials, which includes but isn't
    limited to packaging, boot-up sequence, and marketing materials.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Any use of the Android name must include this attribution in your
  communication:</strong></p>
  <blockquote><em>Android is a trademark of Google LLC.</em></blockquote></p>
  </li>
</ul>
