<p>Thanks for your interest in Android! Here are some ways you can get involved
and help us improve Android. For background on the Android project and our
goals, check out the <a href="../index.html">Overview</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="report-bugs">Report Bugs</h2>

<p>One of the easiest and most effective ways you can help improve Android is
to file bugs. For more information, visit the
<a href="report-bugs.html">Reporting Bugs</a> page.</p>
<p>Please note that we can't guarantee that any particular bug will be fixed in
any particular release. To see what happens to your bug once you report it,
read <a href="life-of-a-bug.html">Life of a Bug</a>.</p>

<h2 id="develop-apps">Develop Apps</h2>
<p>We created Android so that all developers can distribute their applications
to users on an open platform. One of the best ways you can help Android is to
write cool apps that users love!</p>

<p>To get started, visit <a href="https://developer.android.com">developer.android.com</a>. This site
provides the information and tools you need to write applications for
compatible Android devices, using the SDK.</p>

<h2 id="contribute-to-the-code">Contribute to the Code</h2>
<p>Code is King. We'd love to review any changes you submit, so please check
out the source, pick a bug or feature, and get coding. Note that the smaller
and more targetted your patch submissions, the easier it will be for us to
review them.</p>

<p>You can get started with Android by learning about the <a href="life-of-a-patch.html">Life of a Patch</a>,
<code>git</code>, <code>repo</code>, and other tools using the links to the left.
You can also view the activity on all contributions on our
<a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/">Gerrit server</a>. Note, some portions of
Android require you <a href="submit-patches.html#upstream-projects">submit patches to upstream projects</a>.
If you need help along the way, you can join our <a href="../community.html">discussion groups</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="code-styles">Code styles</h3>
    <p>
      For best results when contributing code, follow the code style used in
      that section of AOSP. Most of Android is written in Java, so you should
      follow <a href="/setup/contribute/code-style">AOSP Java code style</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some parts of AOSP are written in Kotlin, such as
      <code>frameworks/base/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/doze/util/BurnInHelper.kt</code>.
      You may use Kotlin in areas of the platform already written in Kotlin.
      For more information about Kotlin in Android, see the Android developer
      <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide"
         class="external">Kotlin style guide</a> and
      <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/interop"
         class="external">Kotlin-Java interop guide</a>. For more extensive
      Kotlin guidance, see the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/"
                                  class="external">Kotlin language site</a>.
