<p>The Android Compatibility Test Suite Verifier (CTS Verifier) supplements the
Compatibility Test Suite (CTS). While CTS checks APIs and functions that can be
automated, CTS Verifier provides tests for APIs and functions that cannot be
tested on a stationary device without manual input, such as audio quality,
touchscreen, accelerometer, camera, etc.</p>

<h2 id=test_preparation>Requirements</h2>
<p>Before running CTS Verifier, ensure you have the following equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android device that has verified Android API compatibility by successfully
passing the CTS. This will be the device-under-test (DUT).</li>
<li>Linux computer with USB 2.0 compatible port. All connections to the DUT will
be through this port.</li>
<li>Second Android device with a known compatible Bluetooth, Wi-Fi direct, and
NFC Host Card Emulation (HCE) implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=setup>Setting up</h2>
<p>To setup the CTS Verifier testing environment:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Linux computer:
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android
SDK</a>.</li>
<li>Download the
<a href="/compatibility/cts/downloads.html">CTS Verifier APK</a> for the
version of Android to test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connect the DUT to the Linux computer.
<li>From a terminal on the Linux computer, install <code>CtsVerifier.apk</code>
on the DUT.
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
adb install -r -g CtsVerifier.apk
</pre>
</li>
<li>Ensure the DUT has the system data and time set correctly.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=cts_test_procedure>Running</h2>
<p>Launch the CTS Verifier application by tapping the CTS icon on the DUT:</p>
<img src="/compatibility/cts/images/cts-verifier-icon.png" alt="CTS Verifier
icon in launcher" id="figure1" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> CTS Verifier icon</figcaption>

<p>The app displays several test sets available for manual verification:</p>
<img src="/compatibility/cts/images/cts-verifier-menu.png" alt="CTS Verifier
menu of tests" id="figure2" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> CTS Verifier menu of tests.</figcaption>

<p>Each test contains a set of common elements (Info, Pass, Fail):</p>
<img src="/compatibility/cts/images/video-verifier.png" alt="Streaming video
quality verifier" id="figure3" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Test elements.</figcaption>

<ul>
<li><strong>Info</strong> (?). Tap to display test instructions. Also appears
automatically the first time a test is opened.</li>
<li><strong>Pass</strong> (✓). Tap if the DUT meets the test requirements per
the Info instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Fail</strong> (!). Tap if the DUT does not meet the test
requirements per the Info instructions.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In some tests, Pass/Fail is
determined automatically.</aside>

<p>Some tests, such as the USB accessory mode and camera calibration test,
require additional test setup and instructions as detailed in the following
sections.</p>

<h3 id=usb_accessory>Testing USB accessory mode</h3>
<p>The USB Accessory test requires a Linux computer to run the USB desktop
machine (host) program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the DUT to the Linux computer.</li>
<li>On the computer, execute the <code>cts-usb-accessory</code> program from the
CTS Verifier package:
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">./cts-usb-accessory</pre>
</li>
<li>Wait for a popup message to appear on the DUT, then select
<strong>OK</strong>.<br>
<img src="/compatibility/cts/images/screen-lock-test.png" alt="CTS Verifier
usb accessory test" id="figure4" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> USB accessory test.</figcaption>
</li>
<li>Go to the USB Accessory Test in the CTS Verifier application.</li>
<li>On the computer, review the output from the console. Example output:
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">

</ol>

<h3 id=camera_field_of_view_calibration>Calibrating camera field of view</h3>
<p>Use the field of view calibration procedure to quickly determine the device
field of view with moderate accuracy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup the test environment:
<ol>
<li>Print the
<a href="/compatibility/calibration-pattern.pdf">calibration-pattern.pdf</a>
target file on 11” x 17” or A3 size paper.</li>
<li>Mount the printed pattern on a rigid backing.</li>
<li>Orient the camera device and the printed target as shown below:<br>
<img src="/compatibility/cts/images/camera-printed-target.png" alt="Camera
printed target" id="figure5" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Camera printed target</figcaption>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set the target width:
<ol>
<li>Measure the distance (in centimeters) between the solid lines on the target
pattern to account for printing inaccuracies (~38 cm).</li>
<li>Start the calibration application.</li>
<li>Press the setup button and select <em>Marker distance</em>.</li>
<li>Measure and enter the distance to the target pattern (~100 cm).</li>
<li>Press the back button to return to the calibration preview.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Verify the device and target are placed as shown in the figure and the
correct distances have been entered into the setup dialog. The preview will
display the image with a vertical line overlaid onto it; this line should align
with the center line of the target pattern. The transparent grid can be used
with the other vertical lines to ensure that the optical axis is orthogonal to
the target.</li>
<li>Run the calibration test:
<ol>
<li>Select an image resolution (using selector at the bottom left), then tap the
screen to take a photo. The test enters calibration mode and displays the photo
with two vertical lines overlaid onto the image.</li>
<li>Determine accuracy:
<ul>
<li>If the lines align with the vertical lines on the target pattern within a
few pixels, the reported field of view for the selected resoultion is accurate.
</li>
<li>If the lines do not align, the reported field of view is inaccurate. To
correct, adjust the slider at the bottom of the screen until the overlay aligns
with the target pattern as closely as possible. When the overlay and the target
pattern image are aligned, the displayed field of view will be a close
approximation to the correct value. The reported field of view should be
within +/-1 degree of the calibration value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Press back button and repeat the calibration test for all image resolutions
supported by the DUT.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=exporting_test_reports>Exporting results</h2>
<p>After all tests complete, you can save the results as a report and download
to a computer. Report names are automatically time-stamped based on the DUT
system time.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tap the <strong>Save (disk)</strong> icon.<br>
<img src="/compatibility/cts/images/verifier-save-icon.png" alt="CTS Verifier
Save icon" id="figure6" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 6.</strong> CTS Verifier Save icon.</figcaption>
<aside class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Android 7.0 and higher do not include
the preview feature.</aside>
</li>
<li>Wait for the popup message to display the path to the saved report (e.g.
<code>/sdcard/verifierReports/ctsVerifierReport-date-time.zip</code>), then
record the path.<br>
<img src="images/path-saved-report.png" alt="CTS Verifier path to saved report"
id="figure7" />
<figcaption><strong>Figure 7.</strong> CTS Verifier path to saved
report.</figcaption>
</li>
<li>Connect the DUT to the Linux computer.</li>
<li>From the Android SDK installation on the Linux computer, download reports
from the connected device using <code>adb pull CTSVerifierReportPath</code>.
<ul>
<li>For Android 7.x and later, download all reports using:
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
adb pull /sdcard/verifierReports
</pre>
</li>
<li>For Android 6.0 and earlier, download all reports using:
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
adb pull /mnt/sdcard/ctsVerifierReports/
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To clear Pass/Fail results, select the results in the CTS Verifier app and
select <em>Menu > Clear</em>.</li>
</ol>
