<p>The Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) is a free, commercial-grade test suite,
available for <a href="/compatibility/cts/downloads">download</a>. The CTS represents the
"mechanism" of compatibility.</p>

<p>The CTS runs on a desktop machine and executes test cases directly on
attached devices or an emulator. The CTS is a set of unit tests designed to be
integrated into the daily workflow (such as via a continuous build system) of
the engineers building a device. Its intent is to reveal incompatibilities
early on, and ensure that the software remains compatible throughout the
development process.</p>


<p>The CTS is an automated testing suite that uses two major software components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
  The CTS <a href="/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed">Trade Federation</a> test harness runs on
    your desktop machine and manages test execution. It offers the ability to
    <a href="/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed/testing/through-suite/android-test-tuning">shard tests</a>
    across multiple Devices Under Test (DUTs). You may also use the
    <a href="/devices/tech/test_infra/tradefed/testing/through-suite/suite-retry">suite retry</a>
    feature to retry the failures only rather than the full suites, greatly reducing re-run time.
</li>
<li>
Individual test cases are executed on the DUT. The test
cases are written in Java as JUnit tests and packaged
Android .apk files to run on the actual device target.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Compatibility Test Suite Verifier (CTS Verifier) is a supplement to the
CTS available for <a href="/compatibility/cts/downloads">download</a>. CTS Verifier
provides tests for APIs and functions that cannot be tested on a stationary
device without manual input (e.g. audio quality, accelerometer, etc).</p>

<p>The CTS Verifier is a tool for manual testing and includes the following software components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CTS verifier app that is executed on the DUT and collects the results.<p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The executable(s) or script(s) that are executed on the desktop machine to
provide data or additional control for some test cases in the CTS Verifier
app.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This diagram summarizes CTS workflow. Please refer to the subpages of this
section starting with <a href="/compatibility/cts/setup">Setup</a> for detailed
instructions.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-test-cases">Types of test cases</h2>
<p>The CTS includes the following types of test cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Unit tests</em> test atomic units of code within the Android platform;
e.g. a single class, such as java.util.HashMap.
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Functional tests</em> test a combination of APIs together in a higher-level use-case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
Future versions of the CTS will include the following types of test cases:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Robustness tests</em> test the durability of the system under stress.
</li>
<li>
<em>Performance tests</em> test the performance of the system against defined benchmarks,
for example rendering frames per second.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-covered">Areas covered</h2>
<p>The unit test cases cover the following areas to ensure compatibility:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Area</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Signature tests</td>
<td>For each Android release, there are XML files describing the signatures of all
public APIs contained in the release. The CTS contains a utility to check those API
signatures against the APIs available on the device. The results from signature
checking are recorded in the test result XML file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Platform API Tests</td>
<td>Test the platform (core libraries and Android Application Framework) APIs as documented
in the SDK <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/classes" class="external">Class Index</a> to
ensure API correctness, including correct class, attribute and method signatures,
correct method behavior, and negative tests to ensure expected behavior for
incorrect parameter handling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dalvik Tests</td>
<td>The tests focus on testing the Dalvik Executable Format.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Platform Data Model</td>
<td>The CTS tests the core platform data model as exposed to application developers
through content providers, as documented in the
SDK <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/package-summary" class="external">
android.provider</a> package: contacts, browser, settings, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Platform Intents</td>
<td>The CTS tests the core platform intents, as documented in the
SDK <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/g-app-intents" class="external">
Available Intents</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Platform Permissions</td>
<td>The CTS tests the core platform permissions, as documented in the
SDK <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission" class="external">
Available Permissions</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Platform Resources</td>
<td>The CTS tests for correct handling of the core platform resource types,
as documented in the
SDK <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources" class="external">
Available Resource Types</a>. This includes tests for: simple values, drawables, nine-patch,
animations, layouts, styles and themes, and loading alternate resources.</td>
