# Design an Android Device

Being open source, Android offers a near-infinite combination of hardware and
software for you to develop devices undreamt by even the operating system's
creators.

Still, for your users to have a coherent experience as they adopt additional
Android devices, consider following established standards while designing and
customizing your implementation.

1. Review the fundamental principles of Android platform development within
   [Architecture](/devices/architecture/), particularly the
   [HIDL](/devices/architecture/hidl/) format introduced in Android 8.0 and the
   [modular system components](/devices/architecture/modular-system) introduced
   in Android {{ androidQVersionNumber }}.

1. Ensure your devices meet requirements to be deemed
   [compatible](/compatibility/overview) with Androidâ€™s core specification, the
   [Android Compatibility Definition Document](/compatibility/cdd).

1. See the [Display](/devices/tech/display/) features and
   [Settings](/devices/tech/settings/settings-guidelines) guidelines for
   help with the user interface.

1. Take advantage of all of the [tests](/compatibility/tests) available to debug
   and improve your Android devices.

1. Follow [security best practices](/security/best-practices) to keep your users
   and devices safe.

1. Familiarize yourself with
   [App Design](https://developer.android.com/design/){: .external} principles and
   [Material Design](https://material.io/design/){: .external} techniques when
   developing user-facing applications.
