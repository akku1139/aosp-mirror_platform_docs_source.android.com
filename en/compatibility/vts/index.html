The Android Vendor Test Suite (VTS) provides extensive new functionality for
Android testing and promotes a test-driven development process. To help the
Android development community interact with test data, Android includes the
following testing resources:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="systems.html">Systems
Testing with VTS</a>. Describes how to use VTS to test an Android native system
implementation, set up a testing environment, then test a patch using a VTS
plan.</li>
<li><strong>VTS Dashboard</strong>. Web-based user interface for viewing VTS
results. Includes details on:
 <ul>
 <li><a href="database.html">Dashboard
 database</a>. A scalable back-end to support the continuous integration
 dashboard.</li>
 <li><a href="ui.html">Dashboard UI</a>. A
 cohesive user interface that uses material design to effectively display
 information about test results, profiling, and coverage.</li>
 <li><a href="setup.html">Dashboard setup</a>.
 Instructions for setting up and configuring the VTS Dashboard.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li><a href="performance.html">binder and hwbinder
performance tests</a>. Tools for measuring throughput and latency.</li>
</ul>
