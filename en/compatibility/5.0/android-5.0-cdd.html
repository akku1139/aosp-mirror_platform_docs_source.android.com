third-party applications
run well on a variety of hardware configurations [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Resources, 61</a>]. Devices MUST properly implement these APIs and behaviors, as detailed in
this section.</p>

<p>The units referenced by the requirements in this section are defined as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>physical diagonal size</strong>—The distance in inches between two opposing corners of the illuminated portion
of the display.
  <li> <strong>dots per inch (dpi)</strong>—The number of pixels encompassed by a linear horizontal or vertical span of
1". Where dpi values are listed, both horizontal and vertical dpi must fall
within the range.
  <li> <strong>aspect ratio</strong>—The ratio of the longer dimension of the screen to the shorter dimension. For
example, a display of 480x854 pixels would be 854 / 480 = 1.779, or roughly
"16:9".
  <li> <strong>density-independent pixel (dp)</strong>—The virtual pixel unit normalized to a 160 dpi screen, calculated as: pixels =
dps * (density / 160).
</ul>

 </tr>
</table>


<p>The Android UI framework supports a variety of different screen sizes, and
allows applications to query the device screen size (aka "screen layout") via
android.content.res.Configuration.screenLayout with the SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_MASK.
Device implementations MUST report the correct screen size as defined in the
Android SDK documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html">Resources, 61</a>] and determined by the upstream Android platform. Specifically, device
implementations MUST report the correct screen size according to the following
logical density-independent pixel (dp) screen dimensions.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Devices MUST have screen sizes of at least 426 dp x 320 dp ('small'), unless it
is an Android Watch device.
  <li> Devices that report screen size 'normal' MUST have screen sizes of at least 480
dp x 320 dp.
  <li> Devices that report screen size 'large' MUST have screen sizes of at least 640
dp x 480 dp.
  <li> Devices that report screen size 'xlarge' MUST have screen sizes of at least 960
dp x 720 dp.
</ul>

<p>In addition, </p>

<ul>
  <li> Android Watch devices MUST have a screen with the physical diagonal size in the
range from 1.1 to 2.5 inches
  <li> Other types of Android device implementations, with a physically integrated
screen, MUST have a screen at least 2.5 inches in physical diagonal size.
</ul>

<p>Devices MUST NOT change their reported screen size at any time.</p>

<p>Applications optionally indicate which screen sizes they support via the
<supports-screens> attribute in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Device
implementations MUST correctly honor applications' stated support for small,
normal, large, and xlarge screens, as described in the Android SDK
documentation.</p>

<h4 id=7_1_1_2_screen_aspect_ratio>7.1.1.2. Screen Aspect Ratio</h4>

<table>
 <tr>
    <td class="tab2"></td>
    <td>
<p>Android Watch devices MAY have an aspect ratio of 1.0 (1:1).</p>
</td>
 </tr>
</table>


<p>The screen aspect ratio MUST be a value from 1.3333 (4:3) to 1.86 (roughly
16:9), but Android Watch devices MAY have an aspect ratio of 1.0 (1:1) because
such a device implementation will use a UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH as the
android.content.res.Configuration.uiMode.</p>

<h4 id=7_1_1_3_screen_density>7.1.1.3. Screen Density</h4>


<p>The Android UI framework defines a set of standard logical densities to help
application developers target application resources. Device implementations
MUST report only one of the following logical Android framework densities
through the android.util.DisplayMetrics APIs, and MUST execute applications at
this standard density and MUST NOT change the value at at any time for the
default display.</p>

<ul>
  <li> 120 dpi (ldpi)
  <li> 160 dpi (mdpi)
  <li> 213 dpi (tvdpi)
  <li> 240 dpi (hdpi)
  <li> 320 dpi (xhdpi)
  <li> 400 dpi (400dpi)
  <li> 480 dpi (xxhdpi)
  <li> 560 dpi (560dpi)
  <li> 640 dpi (xxxhdpi)
</ul>

<p>Device implementations SHOULD define the standard Android framework density
that is numerically closest to the physical density of the screen, unless that
logical density pushes the reported screen size below the minimum supported. If
the standard Android framework density that is numerically closest to the
physical density results in a screen size that is smaller than the smallest
supported compatible screen size (320 dp width), device implementations SHOULD
report the next lowest standard Android framework density.</p>

<h3 id=7_1_2_display_metrics>7.1.2. Display Metrics</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST report correct values for all display metrics
defined in android.util.DisplayMetrics [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html">Resources, 62</a>] and MUST report the same values regardless of whether the embedded or
external screen is used as the default display.</p>

<h3 id=7_1_3_screen_orientation>7.1.3. Screen Orientation</h3>


<p>Devices MUST report which screen orientations they support
(android.hardware.screen.portrait and/or android.hardware.screen.landscape) and
MUST report at least one supported orientation. For example, a device with a
fixed orientation landscape screen, such as a television or laptop, SHOULD only
report android.hardware.screen.landscape.</p>

<p>Devices that report both screen orientations MUST support dynamic orientation
by applications to either portrait or landscape screen orientation. That is,
the device must respect the application's request for a specific screen
orientation. Device implementations MAY select either portrait or landscape
orientation as the default.</p>

<p>Devices MUST report the correct value for the device's current orientation,
whenever queried via the android.content.res.Configuration.orientation,
android.view.Display.getOrientation(), or other APIs.</p>

<p>Devices MUST NOT change the reported screen size or density when changing
orientation.</p>

<h3 id=7_1_4_2d_and_3d_graphics_acceleration>7.1.4. 2D and 3D Graphics Acceleration</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST support both OpenGL ES 1.0 and 2.0, as embodied and
detailed in the Android SDK documentations. Device implementations SHOULD
support OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1 on devices capable of supporting it. Device
implementations MUST also support Android RenderScript, as detailed in the
Android SDK documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/">Resources, 63</a>].</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST also correctly identify themselves as supporting
OpenGL ES 1.0, OpenGL ES 2.0, OpenGL ES 3.0 or OpenGL 3.1. That is:</p>

<ul>
  <li> The managed APIs (such as via the GLES10.getString()method MUST report support
for OpenGL ES 1.0 and OpenGL ES 2.0.
  <li> The native C/C++ OpenGL APIs (APIs available to apps via libGLES_v1CM.so,
libGLES_v2.so, or libEGL.so) MUST report support for OpenGL ES 1.0 and OpenGL
ES 2.0.
  <li> Device implementations that declare support for OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1 MUST
support the corresponding managed APIs and include support for native C/C++
APIs. On device implementations that declare support for OpenGL ES 3.0 or 3.1,
libGLESv2.so MUST export the corresponding function symbols in addition to the
OpenGL ES 2.0 function symbols.
</ul>

<p>In addition to OpenGL ES 3.1, Android provides an extension pack with Java
interfaces [<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLES31Ext.html">Resources, 64</a>] and native support for advanced graphics functionality such as tessellation
and the ASTC texture compression format. Android device implementations MAY
support this extension pack, and—only if fully implemented—MUST identify the
support through the android.hardware.opengles.aep feature flag.</p>

<p>Also, device implementations MAY implement any desired OpenGL ES extensions.
However, device implementations MUST report via the OpenGL ES managed and
native APIs all extension strings that they do support, and conversely MUST NOT
report extension strings that they do not support.</p>

<p>Note that Android includes support for applications to optionally specify that
they require specific OpenGL texture compression formats. These formats are
typically vendor-specific. Device implementations are not required by Android
to implement any specific texture compression format. However, they SHOULD
accurately report any texture compression formats that they do support, via the
getString() method in the OpenGL API.</p>

<p>Android includes a mechanism for applications to declare that they want to
enable hardware acceleration for 2D graphics at the Application, Activity,
Window, or View level through the use of a manifest tag
android:hardwareAccelerated or direct API calls [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html">Resources, 65</a>].</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST enable hardware acceleration by default, and MUST
disable hardware acceleration if the developer so requests by setting
android:hardwareAccelerated="false" or disabling hardware acceleration directly
through the Android View APIs.</p>

<p>In addition, device implementations MUST exhibit behavior consistent with the
Android SDK documentation on hardware acceleration [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html">Resources, 65</a>].</p>

<p>Android includes a TextureView object that lets developers directly integrate
hardware-accelerated OpenGL ES textures as rendering targets in a UI hierarchy.
Device implementations MUST support the TextureView API, and MUST exhibit
consistent behavior with the upstream Android implementation.</p>

<p>Android includes support for EGL_ANDROID_RECORDABLE, an EGLConfig attribute
that indicates whether the EGLConfig supports rendering to an ANativeWindow
that records images to a video. Device implementations MUST support
EGL_ANDROID_RECORDABLE extension [<a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/ANDROID/EGL_ANDROID_recordable.txt">Resources, 66</a>].</p>

<h3 id=7_1_5_legacy_application_compatibility_mode>7.1.5. Legacy Application Compatibility Mode</h3>


<p>Android specifies a "compatibility mode" in which the framework operates in a
'normal' screen size equivalent (320dp width) mode for the benefit of legacy
applications not developed for old versions of Android that pre-date
screen-size independence. Device implementations MUST include support for
legacy application compatibility mode as implemented by the upstream Android
open source code. That is, device implementations MUST NOT alter the triggers
or thresholds at which compatibility mode is activated, and MUST NOT alter the
behavior of the compatibility mode itself.</p>

<h3 id=7_1_6_screen_technology>7.1.6. Screen Technology</h3>


<p>The Android platform includes APIs that allow applications to render rich
graphics to the display. Devices MUST support all of these APIs as defined by
the Android SDK unless specifically allowed in this document. </p>

<ul>
  <li> Devices MUST support displays capable of rendering 16-bit color graphics and
SHOULD support displays capable of 24-bit color graphics.
  <li> Devices MUST support displays capable of rendering animations.
  <li> The display technology used MUST have a pixel aspect ratio (PAR) between 0.9
and 1.15. That is, the pixel aspect ratio MUST be near square (1.0) with a 10 ~
15% tolerance.
</ul>

<h3 id=7_1_7_external_displays>7.1.7. External Displays</h3>


<p>Android includes support for secondary display to enable media sharing
capabilities and developer APIs for accessing external displays. If a device
supports an external display either via a wired, wireless, or an embedded
additional display connection then the device implementation MUST implement the
display manager API as described in the Android SDK documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/display/DisplayManager.html">Resources, 67</a>].</p>

  <li> MUST report the correct value for android.content.res.Configuration.navigation

<p>The availability and visibility requirement of the Home, Recents, and Back
functions differ between device types as described in this section.</p>
</td>
 </tr>
</table>


<p>The Home, Recents, and Back functions (mapped to the key events KEYCODE_HOME,
KEYCODE_APP_SWITCH, KEYCODE_BACK, respectively) are essential to the Android
navigation paradigm and therefore;</p>

<ul>
  <li> Android Handheld device implementations MUST provide the Home, Recents, and
Back functions. 
  <li> Android Television device implementations MUST provide the Home and Back
functions.
  <li> Android Watch device implementations MUST have the Home function available to
the user, and the Back function except for when it is in UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH.
  <li> All other types of device implementations MUST provide the Home and Back
functions.
</ul>

<p>These functions MAY be implemented via dedicated physical buttons (such as
mechanical or capacitive touch buttons), or MAY be implemented using dedicated
software keys on a distinct portion of the screen, gestures, touch panel, etc.
Android supports both implementations. All of these functions MUST be
accessible with a single action (e.g. tap, double-click or gesture) when
visible.</p>

<p>Recents function, if provided, MUST have a visible button or icon unless hidden
together with other navigation functions in full-screen mode. This does not
apply to devices upgrading from earlier Android versions that have physical
buttons for navigation and no recents key.</p>

<p> The Home and Back functions, if provided, MUST each have a visible button or
icon unless hidden together with other navigation functions in full-screen mode
or when the uiMode UI_MODE_TYPE_MASK is set to UI_MODE_TYPE_WATCH.</p>

<p>The Menu function is deprecated in favor of action bar since Android 4.0.
Therefore the new device implementations shipping with Android 5.0 MUST NOT
implement a dedicated physical button for the Menu function. Older device
implementations SHOULD NOT implement a dedicated physical button for the Menu
function, but if the physical Menu button is implemented and the device is
running applications with targetSdkVersion > 10, the device implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST display the action overflow button on the action bar when it is visible
and the resulting action overflow menu popup is not empty. For a device
implementation launched before Android 4.4 but upgrading to Android 5.0, this
is RECOMMENDED.
  <li> MUST NOT modify the position of the action overflow popup displayed by
selecting the overflow button in the action bar
  <li> MAY render the action overflow popup at a modified position on the screen when
it is displayed by selecting the physical menu button
</ul>

<p>For backwards compatibility, device implementations MUST make the Menu function
available to applications when targetSdkVersion <= 10, either by a physical
button, a software key, or gestures. This Menu function should be presented
unless hidden together with other navigation functions.</p>

<p>Android supports Assist action [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_ASSIST">Resources, 69</a>]. Android device implementations except for Android Watch devices MUST make
the Assist action available to the user at all times when running applications.
The Assist action SHOULD be implemented as a long-press on the Home button or a
swipe-up gesture on the software Home key. This function MAY be implemented via
another physical button, software key, or gesture, but MUST be accessible with
a single action (e.g. tap, double-click, or gesture) when other navigation keys
are visible.</p>

<p>Device implementations MAY use a distinct portion of the screen to display the
navigation keys, but if so, MUST meet these requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Device implementation navigation keys MUST use a distinct portion of the
screen, not available to applications, and MUST NOT obscure or otherwise
interfere with the portion of the screen available to applications.
  <li> Device implementations MUST make available a portion of the display to
applications that meets the requirements defined in <a href="#heading=h.mrv5xyps1ba8">section 7.1.1</a>.
  <li> Device implementations MUST display the navigation keys when applications do
not specify a system UI mode, or specify SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_VISIBLE.
  <li> Device implementations MUST present the navigation keys in an unobtrusive "low
profile" (eg. dimmed) mode when applications specify
SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE.
  <li> Device implementations MUST hide the navigation keys when applications specify
SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION.
</ul>

<table>
 <tr>
    <td class="tab2"></td>
    <td>
<p>Android Handhelds and Watch Devices MUST support touchscreen input.</p>
</td>
 </tr>
</table>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD have a pointer input system of some kind (either
mouse-like or touch). However, if a device implementation does not support a
pointer input system, it MUST NOT report the android.hardware.touchscreen or
android.hardware.faketouch feature constant. Device implementations that do
include a pointer input system:</p>

<ul>
  <li> SHOULD support fully independently tracked pointers, if the device input system
supports multiple pointers
  <li> MUST report the value of android.content.res.Configuration.touchscreen [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html">Resources, 68</a>] corresponding to the type of the specific touchscreen on the device
</ul>

<p>Android includes support for a variety of touchscreens, touch pads, and fake
touch input devices. Touchscreen based device implementations are associated
with a display [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/input/touch-devices.html">Resources, 70</a>] such that the user has the impression of directly manipulating items on
screen. Since the user is directly touching the screen, the system does not
require any additional affordances to indicate the objects being manipulated.
In contrast, a fake touch interface provides a user input system that
approximates a subset of touchscreen capabilities. For example, a mouse or
remote control that drives an on-screen cursor approximates touch, but requires
the user to first point or focus then click. Numerous input devices like the
mouse, trackpad, gyro-based air mouse, gyro-pointer, joystick, and multi-touch
trackpad can support fake touch interactions. Android 5.0 includes the feature
constant android.hardware.faketouch, which corresponds to a high-fidelity
non-touch (pointer-based) input device such as a mouse or trackpad that can
adequately emulate touch-based input (including basic gesture support), and
indicates that the device supports an emulated subset of touchscreen
functionality. Device implementations that declare the fake touch feature MUST
meet the fake touch requirements in <a href="#heading=h.7tz929qk2hjr">section 7.2.5</a>.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST report the correct feature corresponding to the
type of input used. Device implementations that include a touchscreen
(single-touch or better) MUST report the platform feature constant
android.hardware.touchscreen. Device implementations that report the platform
feature constant android.hardware.touchscreen MUST also report the platform
feature constant android.hardware.faketouch. Device implementations that do not
include a touchscreen (and rely on a pointer device only) MUST NOT report any
touchscreen feature, and MUST report only android.hardware.faketouch if they
meet the fake touch requirements in <a href="#heading=h.7tz929qk2hjr">section 7.2.5</a>.</p>

<h3 id=7_2_5_fake_touch_input>7.2.5. Fake Touch Input</h3>


<p>Device implementations that declare support for android.hardware.faketouch:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST report the absolute X and Y screen positions of the pointer location and
display a visual pointer on the screen [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html">Resources, 71</a>]
  <li> MUST report touch event with the action code that specifies the state change
that occurs on the pointer going down or up on the screen [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html">Resources, 71</a>]
  <li> MUST support pointer down and up on an object on the screen, which allows users
to emulate tap on an object on the screen
  <li> MUST support pointer down, pointer up, pointer down then pointer up in the same
place on an object on the screen within a time threshold, which allows users to
emulate double tap on an object on the screen [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html">Resources, 71</a>]
  <li> MUST support pointer down on an arbitrary point on the screen, pointer move to
any other arbitrary point on the screen, followed by a pointer up, which allows
users to emulate a touch drag
  <li> MUST support pointer down then allow users to quickly move the object to a
different position on the screen and then pointer up on the screen, which
allows users to fling an object on the screen
</ul>

<p>Devices that declare support for android.hardware.faketouch.multitouch.distinct
MUST meet the requirements for faketouch above, and MUST also support distinct
tracking of two or more independent pointer inputs.</p>

<h3 id=7_2_7_remote_control>7.2.7. Remote Control</h3>


<p>Android Television device implementations SHOULD provide a remote control to
allow users to access the TV interface. The remote control MAY be a physical
remote or can be a software-based remote that is accessible from a mobile phone
or tablet. The remote control MUST meet the requirements defined below.</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Search affordance</strong>—Device implementations MUST fire KEYCODE_SEARCH when the user invokes voice
search either on the physical or software-based remote.
  <li> <strong>Navigation</strong>—All Android Television remotes MUST include Back, Home, and Select buttons and
support for D-pad events [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html">Resources, 72</a>].
</ul>

<h2 id=7_3_sensors>7.3. Sensors</h2>


<p>Android includes APIs for accessing a variety of sensor types. Devices
implementations generally MAY omit these sensors, as provided for in the
following subsections. If a device includes a particular sensor type that has a
corresponding API for third-party developers, the device implementation MUST
implement that API as described in the Android SDK documentation and the
Android Open Source documentation on sensors [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/sensors">Resources, 73</a>]. For example, device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST accurately report the presence or absence of sensors per the
android.content.pm.PackageManager class [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">Resources, 53]</a>
  <li> MUST return an accurate list of supported sensors via the
SensorManager.getSensorList() and similar methods
  <li> MUST behave reasonably for all other sensor APIs (for example, by returning
true or false as appropriate when applications attempt to register listeners,
not calling sensor listeners when the corresponding sensors are not present;
etc.)
  <li> MUST report all sensor measurements using the relevant International System of
Units (metric) values for each sensor type as defined in the Android SDK
documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html">Resources, 74</a>]
  <li> SHOULD report the event time in nanoseconds as defined in the Android SDK
documentation, representing the time the event happened and synchronized with
the SystemClock.elapsedRealtimeNano() clock. Existing and new Android devices
are <strong>very strongly encouraged</strong> to meet these requirement so they will be able to upgrade to the future
platform releases where this might become a REQUIRED component. The
synchronization error SHOULD be below 100 milliseconds [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html#timestamp">Resources, 75</a>].
</ul>

<p>The list above is not comprehensive; the documented behavior of the Android SDK
and the Android Open Source Documentations on Sensors [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/sensors">Resources, 73</a>] is to be considered authoritative.</p>

<p>Some sensor types are composite, meaning they can be derived from data provided
by one or more other sensors. (Examples include the orientation sensor, and the
linear acceleration sensor.) Device implementations SHOULD implement these
sensor types, when they include the prerequisite physical sensors as described
in [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/composite_sensors.html">Resources, 76</a>]. If a device implementation includes a composite sensor it MUST implement the
sensor as described in the Android Open Source documentation on composite
sensors [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/composite_sensors.html">Resources, 76</a>].</p>

<p>Some Android sensor supports a "continuous" trigger mode, which returns data
continuously [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/sensors/base_triggers.html#continuous">Resources, 77</a>]. For any API indicated by the Android SDK documentation to be a continuous
sensor, device implementations MUST continuously provide periodic data samples
that SHOULD have a jitter below 3%, where jitter is defined as the standard
deviation of the difference of the reported timestamp values between
consecutive events.</p>

<p>Note that the device implementations MUST ensure that the sensor event stream
MUST NOT prevent the device CPU from entering a suspend state or waking up from
a suspend state.</p>

<p>Finally, when several sensors are activated, the power consumption SHOULD NOT
exceed the sum of the individual sensor’s reported power consumption.</p>

<h3 id=7_3_1_accelerometer>7.3.1. Accelerometer</h3>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a 3-axis accelerometer. Android Handheld
devices and Android Watch devices are strongly encouraged to include this
sensor. If a device implementation does include a 3-axis accelerometer, it:</p>

deviation should be calculated on a per axis basis on samples collected over a
period of at least 3 seconds at the fastest sampling rate
  <li> SHOULD implement the TYPE_SIGNIFICANT_MOTION, TYPE_TILT_DETECTOR,
TYPE_STEP_DETECTOR, TYPE_STEP_COUNTER composite sensors as described in the
Android SDK document. Existing and new Android devices are <strong>very strongly encouraged</strong> to implement the TYPE_SIGNIFICANT_MOTION composite sensor. If any of these
sensors are implemented, the sum of their power consumption MUST always be less
than 4 mW and SHOULD each be below 2 mW and 0.5 mW for when the device is in a
dynamic or static condition.
  <li> If a gyroscope sensor is included, MUST implement the TYPE_GRAVITY and
TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION composite sensors and SHOULD implement the
TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR composite sensor. Existing and new Android devices
are strongly encouraged to implement the TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR sensor.

and a magnetometer sensor is also included
</ul>

<h3 id=7_3_2_magnetometer>7.3.2. Magnetometer</h3>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a 3-axis magnetometer (compass). If a
device does include a 3-axis magnetometer, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST implement the TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD sensor and SHOULD also implement
TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD_UNCALIBRATED sensor. Existing and new Android devices are
strongly encouraged to implement the TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD_UNCALIBRATED sensor.
  <li> MUST be able to report events up to a frequency of at least 10 Hz and SHOULD
report events up to at least 50 Hz
  <li> MUST comply with the Android sensor coordinate system as detailed in the
Android APIs [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html">Resources, 74</a>]
  <li> MUST be capable of measuring between -900 μT and +900 μT on each axis before
saturating
  <li> MUST have a hard iron offset value less than 700 μT and SHOULD have a value

  <li> MUST have a resolution equal or denser than 0.6 μT and SHOULD have a resolution
equal or denser than 0.2 μT
  <li> SHOULD be temperature compensated
  <li> MUST support online calibration and compensation of the hard iron bias, and
preserve the compensation parameters between device reboots
  <li> MUST have the soft iron compensation applied—the calibration can be done either
while in use or during the production of the device
  <li> SHOULD have a standard deviation, calculated on a per axis basis on samples
collected over a period of at least 3 seconds at the fastest sampling rate, no
greater than 0.5 μT
  <li> SHOULD implement a TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR composite sensor, if an accelerometer
sensor and a gyroscope sensor is also included
  <li> MAY implement the TYPE_GEOMAGNETIC_ROTATION_VECTOR sensor if an accelerometer
sensor is also implemented. However if implemented, it MUST consume less than
10 mW and SHOULD consume less than 3 mW when the sensor is registered for batch
mode at 10 Hz. 
</ul>

<h3 id=7_3_3_gps>7.3.3. GPS</h3>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a GPS receiver. If a device
implementation does include a GPS receiver, it SHOULD include some form of
"assisted GPS" technique to minimize GPS lock-on time.</p>

<h3 id=7_3_4_gyroscope>7.3.4. Gyroscope</h3>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a gyroscope (angular change sensor).
Devices SHOULD NOT include a gyroscope sensor unless a 3-axis accelerometer is
also included. If a device implementation includes a gyroscope, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST implement the TYPE_GYROSCOPE sensor and SHOULD also implement
TYPE_GYROSCOPE_UNCALIBRATED sensor. Existing and new Android devices are
strongly encouraged to implement the SENSOR_TYPE_GYROSCOPE_UNCALIBRATED sensor. 
  <li> MUST be capable of measuring orientation changes up to 1,000 degrees per second
  <li> MUST be able to report events up to a frequency of at least 100 Hz and SHOULD
report events up to at least 200 Hz

parameters between device reboots
  <li> MUST have a variance no greater than 1e-7 rad^2 / s^2 per Hz (variance per Hz,
or rad^2 / s). The variance is allowed to vary with the sampling rate, but must
be constrained by this value. In other words, if you measure the variance of
the gyro at 1 Hz sampling rate it should be no greater than 1e-7 rad^2/s^2.
  <li> SHOULD implement a TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR composite sensor, if an accelerometer
sensor and a magnetometer sensor is also included
  <li> If an accelerometer sensor is included, MUST implement the TYPE_GRAVITY and
TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION composite sensors and SHOULD implement the
TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR composite sensor. Existing and new Android devices
are strongly encouraged to implement the TYPE_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR sensor.
</ul>

<h3 id=7_3_5_barometer>7.3.5. Barometer</h3>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a barometer (ambient air pressure
sensor). If a device implementation includes a barometer, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST implement and report TYPE_PRESSURE sensor
  <li> MUST be able to deliver events at 5 Hz or greater
  <li> MUST have adequate precision to enable estimating altitude
  <li> MUST be temperature compensated
</ul>

<h3 id=7_3_6_thermometer>7.3.6. Thermometer</h3>


<p>Device implementations MAY include an ambient thermometer (temperature sensor).
If present, it MUST be defined as SENSOR_TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE and it MUST
measure the ambient (room) temperature in degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Device implementations MAY but SHOULD NOT include a CPU temperature sensor. If
present, it MUST be defined as SENSOR_TYPE_TEMPERATURE, it MUST measure the
temperature of the device CPU, and it MUST NOT measure any other temperature.
Note the SENSOR_TYPE_TEMPERATURE sensor type was deprecated in Android 4.0.</p>

<h3 id=7_3_7_photometer>7.3.7. Photometer</h3>


<p>Device implementations MAY include a photometer (ambient light sensor).</p>

<h3 id=7_3_8_proximity_sensor>7.3.8. Proximity Sensor</h3>


<p>Device implementations MAY include a proximity sensor. Devices that can make a
voice call and indicate any value other than PHONE_TYPE_NONE in getPhoneType
SHOULD include a proximity sensor. If a device implementation does include a
proximity sensor, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST measure the proximity of an object in the same direction as the screen.
That is, the proximity sensor MUST be oriented to detect objects close to the
screen, as the primary intent of this sensor type is to detect a phone in use
by the user. If a device implementation includes a proximity sensor with any
other orientation, it MUST NOT be accessible through this API.
  <li> MUST have 1-bit of accuracy or more
</ul>

<h2 id=7_4_data_connectivity>7.4. Data Connectivity</h2>


<h3 id=7_4_1_telephony>7.4.1. Telephony</h3>


<p>"Telephony" as used by the Android APIs and this document refers specifically
to hardware related to placing voice calls and sending SMS messages via a GSM
or CDMA network. While these voice calls may or may not be packet-switched,
they are for the purposes of Android considered independent of any data
connectivity that may be implemented using the same network. In other words,
the Android "telephony" functionality and APIs refer specifically to voice
calls and SMS. For instance, device implementations that cannot place calls or
send/receive SMS messages MUST NOT report the android.hardware.telephony
feature or any subfeatures, regardless of whether they use a cellular network
for data connectivity.</p>

<p>Android MAY be used on devices that do not include telephony hardware. That is,
Android is compatible with devices that are not phones. However, if a device
implementation does include GSM or CDMA telephony, it MUST implement full
support for the API for that technology. Device implementations that do not
include telephony hardware MUST implement the full APIs as no-ops.</p>

      <li> NFC Forum Tag Types 1, 2, 3, 4 (defined by the NFC Forum)
    </ul>
  <li> SHOULD be capable of reading and writing NDEF messages via the following NFC
standards. Note that while the NFC standards below are stated as SHOULD, the
Compatibility Definition for a future version is planned to change these to
MUST. These standards are optional in this version but will be required in
future versions. Existing and new devices that run this version of Android are <strong>very strongly encouraged</strong> to meet these requirements now so they will be able to upgrade to the future
platform releases.
  <ul>
    <li> NfcV (ISO 15693)

  <li> MUST include support for Android Beam [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc.html">Resources, 85</a>]:
  <ul>
    <li> MUST implement the SNEP default server. Valid NDEF messages received by the
default SNEP server MUST be dispatched to applications using the
android.nfc.ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED intent. Disabling Android Beam in settings
MUST NOT disable dispatch of incoming NDEF message.
    <li> MUST honor the android.settings.NFCSHARING_SETTINGS intent to show NFC sharing
settings [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html#ACTION_NFCSHARING_SETTINGS">Resources, 86</a>]
    <li> MUST implement the NPP server. Messages received by the NPP server MUST be
processed the same way as the SNEP default server.
    <li> MUST implement a SNEP client and attempt to send outbound P2P NDEF to the
default SNEP server when Android Beam is enabled. If no default SNEP server is
found then the client MUST attempt to send to an NPP server.
    <li> MUST allow foreground activities to set the outbound P2P NDEF message using
android.nfc.NfcAdapter.setNdefPushMessage, and
android.nfc.NfcAdapter.setNdefPushMessageCallback, and
android.nfc.NfcAdapter.enableForegroundNdefPush

    <li> SHOULD enable Android Beam by default and MUST be able to send and receive
using Android Beam, even when another proprietary NFC P2p mode is turned on
    <li> MUST support NFC Connection handover to Bluetooth when the device supports
Bluetooth Object Push Profile. Device implementations MUST support connection
handover to Bluetooth when using android.nfc.NfcAdapter.setBeamPushUris, by
implementing the "Connection Handover version 1.2" [<a href="http://www.nfc-forum.org/specs/spec_list/#conn_handover">Resources, 87</a>] and "Bluetooth Secure Simple Pairing Using NFC version 1.0" [<a href="http://members.nfc-forum.org/apps/group_public/download.php/18688/NFCForum-AD-BTSSP_1_1.pdf">Resources, 88</a>] specs from the NFC Forum. Such an implementation MUST implement the handover
LLCP service with service name "urn:nfc:sn:handover" for exchanging the
handover request/select records over NFC, and it MUST use the Bluetooth Object
Push Profile for the actual Bluetooth data transfer. For legacy reasons (to
remain compatible with Android 4.1 devices), the implementation SHOULD still
accept SNEP GET requests for exchanging the handover request/select records
over NFC. However an implementation itself SHOULD NOT send SNEP GET requests
for performing connection handover.
  </ul>
  <li> MUST poll for all supported technologies while in NFC discovery mode
  <li> SHOULD be in NFC discovery mode while the device is awake with the screen
active and the lock-screen unlocked

Forum specifications cited above.)</p>

<p>Android 5.0 includes support for NFC Host Card Emulation (HCE) mode. If a
device implementation does include an NFC controller capable of HCE and
Application ID (AID) routing, then it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST report the android.hardware.nfc.hce feature constant
  <li> MUST support NFC HCE APIs as defined in the Android SDK [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/hce.html">Resources, 10</a>]
</ul>

<p>Additionally, device implementations MAY include reader/writer support for the
following MIFARE technologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li> MIFARE Classic
  <li> MIFARE Ultralight 
  <li> NDEF on MIFARE Classic 
</ul>

<p>Note that Android includes APIs for these MIFARE types. If a device
implementation supports MIFARE in the reader/writer role, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST implement the corresponding Android APIs as documented by the Android SDK
  <li> MUST report the feature com.nxp.mifare from the
android.content.pm.PackageManager.hasSystemFeature() meth<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">od [Resources, 53]</a>. Note that this is not a standard Android feature and as such does not appear
as a constant on the PackageManager class.
  <li> MUST NOT implement the corresponding Android APIs nor report the com.nxp.mifare
feature unless it also implements general NFC support as described in this
section
</ul>

<p>If a device implementation does not include NFC hardware, it MUST NOT declare
the android.hardware.nfc feature from the
android.content.pm.PackageManager.hasSystemFeature() method [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html">Resources, 53]</a>, and MUST implement the Android NFC API as a no-op.</p>

<p>As the classes android.nfc.NdefMessage and android.nfc.NdefRecord represent a
protocol-independent data representation format, device implementations MUST
implement these APIs even if they do not include support for NFC or declare the
android.hardware.nfc feature.</p>

<h3 id=7_4_5_minimum_network_capability>7.4.5. Minimum Network Capability</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST include support for one or more forms of data

<p>Device implementations MUST have the master auto-sync setting on by default so
that the method getMasterSyncAutomatically() returns "true" [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver.html">Resources, 89</a>].</p>

<h2 id=7_5_cameras>7.5. Cameras</h2>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a rear-facing camera and MAY include a
front-facing camera. A rear-facing camera is a camera located on the side of
the device opposite the display; that is, it images scenes on the far side of
the device, like a traditional camera. A front-facing camera is a camera
located on the same side of the device as the display; that is, a camera
typically used to image the user, such as for video conferencing and similar
applications.</p>

<p>If a device implementation includes at least one camera, it SHOULD be possible
for an application to simultaneously allocate 3 bitmaps equal to the size of
the images produced by the largest-resolution camera sensor on the device.</p>

<h3 id=7_5_1_rear-facing_camera>7.5.1. Rear-Facing Camera</h3>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD include a rear-facing camera. If a device
implementation includes at least one rear-facing camera, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST report the feature flag android.hardware.camera and
android.hardware.camera.any 
  <li> MUST have a resolution of at least 2 megapixels
  <li> SHOULD have either hardware auto-focus or software auto-focus implemented in
the camera driver (transparent to application software)
  <li> MAY have fixed-focus or EDOF (extended depth of field) hardware
  <li> MAY include a flash. If the Camera includes a flash, the flash lamp MUST NOT be
lit while an android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback instance has been
registered on a Camera preview surface, unless the application has explicitly
enabled the flash by enabling the FLASH_MODE_AUTO or FLASH_MODE_ON attributes
of a Camera.Parameters object. Note that this constraint does not apply to the
device's built-in system camera application, but only to third-party
applications using Camera.PreviewCallback.
</ul>

<h3 id=7_5_2_front-facing_camera>7.5.2. Front-Facing Camera</h3>


<p>Device implementations MAY include a front-facing camera. If a device
implementation includes at least one front-facing camera, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST report the feature flag android.hardware.camera.any and
android.hardware.camera.front
  <li> MUST have a resolution of at least VGA (640x480 pixels)
  <li> MUST NOT use a front-facing camera as the default for the Camera API. The
camera API in Android has specific support for front-facing cameras and device
implementations MUST NOT configure the API to to treat a front-facing camera as
the default rear-facing camera, even if it is the only camera on the device.
  <li> MAY include features (such as auto-focus, flash, etc.) available to rear-facing
cameras as described in <a href="#heading=h.v6dmzvarwqkm">section 7.5.1</a>
  <li> MUST horizontally reflect (i.e. mirror) the stream displayed by an app in a
CameraPreview, as follows:
  <ul>
    <li> If the device implementation is capable of being rotated by user (such as
automatically via an accelerometer or manually via user input), the camera
preview MUST be mirrored horizontally relative to the device's current
orientation.
    <li> If the current application has explicitly requested that the Camera display be
rotated via a call to the android.hardware.Camera.setDisplayOrientation()[<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html#setDisplayOrientation(int)">Resources, 90</a>] method, the camera preview MUST be mirrored horizontally relative to the
orientation specified by the application.
    <li> Otherwise, the preview MUST be mirrored along the device's default horizontal
axis.
  </ul>
  <li> MUST mirror the image displayed by the postview in the same manner as the
camera preview image stream. If the device implementation does not support
postview, this requirement obviously does not apply.
  <li> MUST NOT mirror the final captured still image or video streams returned to
application callbacks or committed to media storage
</ul>

<h3 id=7_5_3_external_camera>7.5.3. External Camera</h3>


<p>Device implementations with USB host mode MAY include support for an external
camera that connects to the USB port. If a device includes support for an
external camera, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST declare the platform feature android.hardware.camera.external and
android.hardware camera.any
  <li> MUST support USB Video Class (UVC 1.0 or higher)
  <li> MAY support multiple cameras
</ul>

<p>Video compression (such as MJPEG) support is RECOMMENDED to enable transfer of
high-quality unencoded streams (i.e. raw or independently compressed picture
streams). Camera-based video encoding MAY be supported. If so, a simultaneous
unencoded/ MJPEG stream (QVGA or greater resolution) MUST be accessible to the
device implementation. </p>

<h3 id=7_5_4_camera_api_behavior>7.5.4. Camera API Behavior</h3>


<p>Android includes two API packages to access the camera, the newer
android.hardware.camera2 API expose lower-level camera control to the app,
including efficient zero-copy burst/streaming flows and per-frame controls of
exposure, gain, white balance gains, color conversion, denoising, sharpening,
and more. </p>

<p>The older API package, android.hardware.Camera, is marked as deprecated in
Android 5.0 but as it should still be available for apps to use Android device
implementations MUST ensure the continued support of the API as described in
this section and in the Android SDK.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST implement the following behaviors for the
camera-related APIs, for all available cameras:</p>

<ul>
  <li> If an application has never called
android.hardware.Camera.Parameters.setPreviewFormat(int), then the device MUST
use android.hardware.PixelFormat.YCbCr_420_SP for preview data provided to
application callbacks.
  <li> If an application registers an android.hardware.Camera.PreviewCallback instance
and the system calls the onPreviewFrame() method when the preview format is
YCbCr_420_SP, the data in the byte[] passed into onPreviewFrame() must further
be in the NV21 encoding format. That is, NV21 MUST be the default.
  <li> For android.hardware.Camera, device implementations MUST support the YV12
format (as denoted by the android.graphics.ImageFormat.YV12 constant) for
camera previews for both front- and rear-facing cameras. (The hardware video
encoder and camera may use any native pixel format, but the device
implementation MUST support conversion to YV12.)
  <li> For android.hardware.camera2, device implementations must support the
android.hardware.ImageFormat.YUV_420_888 and android.hardware.ImageFormat.JPEG
formats as outputs through the android.media.ImageReader API.
</ul>

<p>Device implementations MUST still implement the full Camera API included in the
Android SDK documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html">Resources, 91</a>], regardless of whether the device includes hardware autofocus or other
capabilities. For instance, cameras that lack autofocus MUST still call any
registered android.hardware.Camera.AutoFocusCallback instances (even though
this has no relevance to a non-autofocus camera.) Note that this does apply to
front-facing cameras; for instance, even though most front-facing cameras do
not support autofocus, the API callbacks must still be "faked" as described.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST recognize and honor each parameter name defined as
a constant on the android.hardware.Camera.Parameters class, if the underlying
hardware supports the feature. If the device hardware does not support a
feature, the API must behave as documented. Conversely, device implementations
MUST NOT honor or recognize string constants passed to the
android.hardware.Camera.setParameters() method other than those documented as
constants on the android.hardware.Camera.Parameters. That is, device
implementations MUST support all standard Camera parameters if the hardware
allows, and MUST NOT support custom Camera parameter types. For instance,
device implementations that support image capture using high dynamic range
(HDR) imaging techniques MUST support camera parameter Camera.SCENE_MODE_HDR [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters.html">Resources, 92</a>].</p>

<p>Because not all device implementations can fully support all the features of
the android.hardware.camera2 API, device implementations MUST report the proper
level of support with the android.info.supportedHardwareLevel property as
described in the Android SDK [<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCharacteristics.html#INFO_SUPPORTED_HARDWARE_LEVEL">Resources, 93]</a> and report the appropriate framework feature flags [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/camera/versioning.html">Resources, 94]</a>. </p>

<p>Device implementations MUST also declare its Individual camera capabilities of
android.hardware.camera2 via the android.request.availableCapabilities property
and declare the appropriate feature flags [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/camera/versioning.html">Resources, 94]</a>; a device must define the feature flag if any of its attached camera devices
supports the feature. </p>

<p>Device implementations MUST broadcast the Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE intent
whenever a new picture is taken by the camera and the entry of the picture has
been added to the media store.</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST broadcast the Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO intent
whenever a new video is recorded by the camera and the entry of the picture has
been added to the media store.</p>

<h3 id=7_5_5_camera_orientation>7.5.5. Camera Orientation</h3>


<p>Both front- and rear-facing cameras, if present, MUST be oriented so that the
long dimension of the camera aligns with the screen's long dimension. That is,
when the device is held in the landscape orientation, cameras MUST capture
images in the landscape orientation. This applies regardless of the device's
natural orientation; that is, it applies to landscape-primary devices as well
as portrait-primary devices.</p>

<p>The minimum memory values MUST be in addition to any memory space already
dedicated to hardware components such as radio, video, and so on that is not
under the kernel's control.</p>

<p>Android Television devices MUST have at least 5GB and other device
implementations MUST have at least 1.5GB of non-volatile storage available for
application private data. That is, the /data partition MUST be at least 5GB for
Android Television devices and at least 1.5GB for other device implementations.
Device implementations that run Android are <strong>very strongly encouraged</strong> to have at least 3GB of non-volatile storage for application private data so
they will be able to upgrade to the future platform releases.</p>

<p>The Android APIs include a Download Manager that applications MAY use to
download data files [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html">Resources, 95</a>]. The device implementation of the Download Manager MUST be capable of
downloading individual files of at least 100MB in size to the default "cache"
location.</p>

<h3 id=7_6_2_application_shared_storage>7.6.2. Application Shared Storage</h3>


<p>Device implementations MUST offer shared storage for applications also often
referred as “shared external storage”. </p>

<p>Device implementations MUST be configured with shared storage mounted by
default, "out of the box". If the shared storage is not mounted on the Linux
path /sdcard, then the device MUST include a Linux symbolic link from /sdcard
to the actual mount point.</p>

<p>Device implementations MAY have hardware for user-accessible removable storage,
such as a Secure Digital (SD) card slot. If this slot is used to satisfy the
shared storage requirement, the device implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST implement a toast or pop-up user interface warning the user when there is
no SD card
  <li> MUST include a FAT-formatted SD card 1GB in size or larger OR show on the box
and other material available at time of purchase that the SD card has to be
separately purchased
  <li> MUST mount the SD card by default
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, device implementations MAY allocate internal (non-removable)
storage as shared storage for apps as included in the upstream Android Open
Source Project; device implementations SHOULD use this configuration and
software implementation. If a device implementation uses internal
(non-removable) storage to satisfy the shared storage requirement, that storage
MUST be 1GB in size or larger and mounted on /sdcard (or /sdcard MUST be a
symbolic link to the physical location if it is mounted elsewhere).</p>

<p>Device implementations MUST enforce as documented the
android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission on this shared storage.
Shared storage MUST otherwise be writable by any application that obtains that
permission.</p>

<p>Device implementations that include multiple shared storage paths (such as both
an SD card slot and shared internal storage) MUST NOT allow Android
applications to write to the secondary external storage, except for their
package-specific directories on the secondary external storage, but SHOULD
expose content from both storage paths transparently through Android's media
scanner service and android.provider.MediaStore.</p>

<p>Regardless of the form of shared storage used, device implementations MUST
provide some mechanism to access the contents of shared storage from a host
computer, such as USB mass storage (UMS) or Media Transfer Protocol (MTP).
Device implementations MAY use USB mass storage, but SHOULD use Media Transfer
Protocol. If the device implementation supports Media Transfer Protocol, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> SHOULD be compatible with the reference Android MTP host, Android File Transfer
[<a href="http://www.android.com/filetransfer">Resources, 96</a>]
  <li> SHOULD report a USB device class of 0x00
  <li> SHOULD report a USB interface name of 'MTP'
</ul>

<p>If the device implementation lacks USB ports, it MUST provide a host computer
with access to the contents of shared storage by some other means, such as a
network file system.</p>

<h2 id=7_7_usb>7.7. USB</h2>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD support USB peripheral mode and SHOULD support
USB host mode.</p>

<p>If a device implementation includes a USB port supporting peripheral mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li> The port MUST be connectable to a USB host that has a standard type-A or type
-C USB port.
  <li> The port SHOULD use micro-A, micro-AB or type-C USB form factor. Existing and
new Android devices are <strong>very strongly encouraged to meet these requirements</strong> so they will be able to upgrade to the future platform releases.
  <li> The port SHOULD be centered in the middle of an edge. Device implementations
SHOULD either locate the port on the bottom of the device (according to natural
orientation) or enable software screen rotation for all apps (including home
screen), so that the display draws correctly when the device is oriented with
the port at bottom. Existing and new Android devices are <strong>very strongly encouraged to meet these requirements</strong> so they will be able to upgrade to future platform releases.
  <li> It MUST allow a USB host connected with the Android device to access the
contents of the shared storage volume using either USB mass storage or Media
Transfer.
  <li> It SHOULD implement the Android Open Accessory (AOA) API and specification as
documented in the Android SDK documentation, and if it is an Android Handheld
device it MUST implement the AOA API. Device implementations implementing the
AOA specification:
  <ul>
    <li> MUST declare support for the hardware feature android.hardware.usb.accessory [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/accessory.html">Resources, 97</a>]
    <li> MUST implement the USB audio class as documented in the Android SDK
documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/usb/UsbConstants.html#USB_CLASS_AUDIO">Resources, 98</a>]
  </ul>
  <li> It SHOULD implement support to draw 1.5 A current during HS chirp and traffic
as specified in the USB battery charging specification [<a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/USB_Battery_Charging_1.2.pdf">Resources, 99</a>]. Existing and new Android devices are <strong>very strongly encouraged to meet these requirements</strong> so they will be able to upgrade to the future platform releases.
  <li> The value of iSerialNumber in USB standard device descriptor MUST be equal to
the value of android.os.Build.SERIAL.
</ul>

<p>If a device implementation includes a USB port supporting host mode, it:</p>

<ul>
  <li> SHOULD use a type-C USB port, if the device implementation supports USB 3.1
  <li> MAY use a non-standard port form factor, but if so MUST ship with a cable or
cables adapting the port to a standard type-A or type-C USB port
  <li> MAY use a micro-AB USB port, but if so SHOULD ship with a cable or cables
adapting the port to a standard type-A or type-C USB port
  <li> is <strong>very strongly RECOMMENDED</strong> to implement the USB audio class as documented in the Android SDK
documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/usb/UsbConstants.html#USB_CLASS_AUDIO">Resources, 98</a>]
  <li> MUST implement the Android USB host API as documented in the Android SDK, and
MUST declare support for the hardware feature android.hardware.usb.host [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/host.html">Resources, 100</a>]
  <li> SHOULD support the Charging Downstream Port output current range of 1.5 A ~ 5 A
as specified in the USB Battery Charging Specifications [<a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/USB_Battery_Charging_1.2.pdf">Resources, 99</a>]

<h1 id=8_performance_compatibility>8. Performance Compatibility</h1>


<p>Some minimum performance criterias are critical to the user experience and

Android Watch devices SHOULD and other type of device implementations MUST meet
the following criteria:</p>

<h2 id=8_1_user_experience_consistency>8.1. User Experience Consistency</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST provide a smooth user interface by ensuring a
consistent frame rate and response times for applications and games. Device
implementations MUST meet the following requirements: </p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Consistent frame latency</strong>Inconsistent frame latency or a delay to render frames MUST NOT happen more
often than 5 frames in a second, and SHOULD be below 1 frames in a second. 
  <li> <strong>User interface latency</strong>Device implementations MUST ensure low latency user experience by scrolling a
list of 10K list entries as defined by the Android Compatibility Test Suite
(CTS) in less than 36 secs. 
  <li> <strong>Task switching</strong>When multiple applications have been launched, re-launching an already-running
application after it has been launched MUST take less than 1 second.
</ul>

<h2 id=8_2_file_i_o_access_performance>8.2. File I/O Access Performance</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Sequential write</strong>Device implementations MUST ensure a sequential write performance of 5MB/s
for a 256MB file using 10MB write buffer. 
  <li> <strong>Random write</strong>Device implementations MUST ensure a random write performance of 0.5MB/s for a
256MB file using 4KB write buffer. 
  <li> <strong>Sequential read</strong>Device implementations MUST ensure a sequential read performance of 15MB/s for

  <li> <strong>Random read</strong>Device implementations MUST ensure a random read performance of 3.5MB/s for a
256MB file using 4KB write buffer. 
</ul>

<h1 id=9_security_model_compatibility>9. Security Model Compatibility</h1>


<p>Device implementations MUST implement a security model consistent with the
Android platform security model as defined in Security and Permissions
reference document in the APIs [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Resources, 102</a>] in the Android developer documentation. Device implementations MUST support
installation of self-signed applications without requiring any additional
permissions/certificates from any third parties/authorities. Specifically,
compatible devices MUST support the security mechanisms described in the follow
subsections.</p>

<h2 id=9_1_permissions>9.1. Permissions</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST support the Android permissions model as defined in
the Android developer documentation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Resources, 102</a>]. Specifically, implementations MUST enforce each permission defined as
described in the SDK documentation; no permissions may be omitted, altered, or
ignored. Implementations MAY add additional permissions, provided the new
permission ID strings are not in the android.* namespace.</p>

<h2 id=9_2_uid_and_process_isolation>9.2. UID and Process Isolation</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST support the Android application sandbox model, in
which each application runs as a unique Unixstyle UID and in a separate
process. Device implementations MUST support running multiple applications as
the same Linux user ID, provided that the applications are properly signed and
constructed, as defined in the Security and Permissions reference [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Resources, 102</a>].</p>

<h2 id=9_3_filesystem_permissions>9.3. Filesystem Permissions</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST support the Android file access permissions model
as defined in the Security and Permissions reference [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Resources, 102</a>].</p>

<h2 id=9_4_alternate_execution_environments>9.4. Alternate Execution Environments</h2>


<p>Device implementations MAY include runtime environments that execute
applications using some other software or technology than the Dalvik Executable
Format or native code. However, such alternate execution environments MUST NOT
compromise the Android security model or the security of installed Android
applications, as described in this section.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST themselves be Android applications, and abide by the
standard Android security model, as described elsewhere in <a href="#heading=h.a32osmf1tmwt">section 9</a>.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST NOT be granted access to resources protected by
permissions not requested in the runtime's AndroidManifest.xml file via the
<uses-permission> mechanism.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST NOT permit applications to make use of features
protected by Android permissions restricted to system applications.</p>

<p>Alternate runtimes MUST abide by the Android sandbox model. Specifically,
alternate runtimes:</p>

<ul>
  <li> SHOULD install apps via the PackageManager into separate Android sandboxes (
Linux user IDs, etc.)
  <li> MAY provide a single Android sandbox shared by all applications using the
alternate runtime
  <li> and installed applications using an alternate runtime, MUST NOT reuse the
sandbox of any other app installed on the device, except through the standard
Android mechanisms of shared user ID and signing certificate
  <li> MUST NOT launch with, grant, or be granted access to the sandboxes
corresponding to other Android applications
  <li> MUST NOT be launched with, be granted, or grant to other applications any
privileges of the superuser (root), or of any other user ID
</ul>

<p>The .apk files of alternate runtimes MAY be included in the system image of a
device implementation, but MUST be signed with a key distinct from the key used
to sign other applications included with the device implementation.</p>

<p>When installing applications, alternate runtimes MUST obtain user consent for
the Android permissions used by the application. If an application needs to
make use of a device resource for which there is a corresponding Android
permission (such as Camera, GPS, etc.), the alternate runtime MUST inform the
user that the application will be able to access that resource. If the runtime
environment does not record application capabilities in this manner, the
runtime environment MUST list all permissions held by the runtime itself when
installing any application using that runtime.</p>

<h2 id=9_5_multi-user_support>9.5. Multi-User Support</h2>

<table>
 <tr>
    <td class="tab2"></td>
    <td>
<p>This feature is optional for all device types.</p>
</td>
 </tr>
</table>


<p>Android includes support for multiple users and provides support for full user
isolation [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html">Resources, 103]</a>. Device implementations MAY enable multiple users, but when enabled MUST meet
the following requirements related to multi-user support [<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/storage">Resources, 104</a>]:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Device implementations that do not declare the android.hardware.telephony
feature flag MUST support restricted profiles, a feature that allows device
owners to manage additional users and their capabilities on the device. With
restricted profiles, device owners can quickly set up separate environments for
additional users to work in, with the ability to manage finer-grained
restrictions in the apps that are available in those environments.
  <li> Conversely device implementations that declare the android.hardware.telephony
feature flag MUST NOT support restricted profiles but MUST align with the AOSP
implementation of controls to enable /disable other users from accessing the
voice calls and SMS.
  <li> Device implementations MUST, for each user, implement a security model
consistent with the Android platform security model as defined in Security and
Permissions reference document in the APIs [<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html">Resources, 102</a>]
  <li> Device implementations MAY support creating users and managed profiles via the
android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager APIs, and if supported, MUST declare the
platform feature flag android.software.managed_users. 
  <li> Device implementations that declare the feature flag
android.software.managed_users MUST use the upstream AOSP icon badge to
represent the managed applications and other badge UI elements like Recents &
Notifications. 
  <li> Each user instance on an Android device MUST have separate and isolated
external storage directories. Device implementations MAY store multiple users'
data on the same volume or filesystem. However, the device implementation MUST
ensure that applications owned by and running on behalf a given user cannot
list, read, or write to data owned by any other user. Note that removable
media, such as SD card slots, can allow one user to access another's data by
means of a host PC. For this reason, device implementations that use removable
media for the external storage APIs MUST encrypt the contents of the SD card if
multiuser is enabled using a key stored only on non-removable media accessible
only to the system. As this will make the media unreadable by a host PC, device
implementations will be required to switch to MTP or a similar system to
provide host PCs with access to the current user's data. Accordingly, device
implementations MAY but SHOULD NOT enable multi-user if they use removable
media [<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html">Resources, 105</a>] for primary external storage. 
</ul>

<h2 id=9_6_premium_sms_warning>9.6. Premium SMS Warning</h2>


<p>Android includes support for warning users of any outgoing premium SMS message
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_code">Resources, 106</a>] . Premium SMS messages are text messages sent to a service registered with a
carrier that may incur a charge to the user. Device implementations that
declare support for android.hardware.telephony MUST warn users before sending a
SMS message to numbers identified by regular expressions defined in
/data/misc/sms/codes.xml file in the device. The upstream Android Open Source
Project provides an implementation that satisfies this requirement.</p>

<h2 id=9_7_kernel_security_features>9.7. Kernel Security Features</h2>


<p>The Android Sandbox includes features that use the Security-Enhanced Linux
(SELinux) mandatory access control (MAC) system and other security features in
the Linux kernel. SELinux or any other security features implemented below
the Android framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST maintain compatibility with existing applications
  <li> MUST NOT have a visible user interface when a security violation is detected
and successfully blocked, but MAY have a visible user interface when an
unblocked security violation occurs resulting in a successful exploit
  <li> SHOULD NOT be user or developer configurable
</ul>

<p>If any API for configuration of policy is exposed to an application that can
affect another application (such as a Device Administration API), the API MUST
NOT allow configurations that break compatibility. </p>

<p>Devices MUST implement SELinux or, if using a kernel other than Linux, an equivalent mandatory access control system.
Devices must also meet the following requirements, which
are satisfied by the reference implementation in the upstream Android Open
Source Project.</p>

<p>Device implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li> MUST set SELinux to global enforcing mode,
  <li> MUST configure all domains in enforcing mode. No
permissive mode domains are allowed, including domains specific to a
device/vendor.
  <li> MUST NOT modify, omit, or replace the neverallow rules present within the
external/sepolicy folder provided in the upstream Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and
the policy MUST compile with all neverallow rules present, for both AOSP SELinux
domains as well as device/vendor specific domains.
</ul>

<p>Device implementations SHOULD retain the default SELinux policy provided in the external/sepolicy folder of the
upstream Android Open Source Project and only further add to this policy for their own device-specific configuration. Device implementations MUST be compatible with
the upstream Android Open Source Project.</p>

<h2 id=9_8_privacy>9.8. Privacy</h2>


<p>If the device implements functionality in the system that captures the contents
displayed on the screen and/or records the audio stream played on the device,
it MUST continuously notify the user whenever this functionality is enabled and
actively capturing/recording.</p>

<h2 id=9_9_full-disk_encryption>9.9. Full-Disk Encryption</h2>

<table>
 <tr>
    <td class="tab2"></td>
    <td>
<p>Optional for Android device implementations without a lock screen.</p>
</td>
 </tr>
</table>


<p>If the device implementation has a lock screen, the device MUST support
full-disk encryption of the application private data, (/data partition) as well
as the SD card partition if it is a permanent, non-removable part of the device
[<a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/encryption/index.html">Resources, 107</a>]. For devices supporting full-disk encryption, the full-disk encryption SHOULD
be enabled all the time after the user has completed the out-of-box experience.
While this requirement is stated as SHOULD for this version of the Android
platform, it is <strong>very strongly RECOMMENDED</strong> as we expect this to change to MUST in the future versions of Android.
Encryption MUST use AES with a key of 128-bits (or greater) and a mode designed
for storage (for example, AES-XTS, AES-CBC-ESSIV). The encryption key MUST NOT
be written to storage at any time without being encrypted. Other than when in
active use, the encryption key SHOULD be AES encrypted with the lockscreen
passcode stretched using a slow stretching algorithm (e.g. PBKDF2 or scrypt).
If the user has not specified a lockscreen passcode or has disabled use of the
passcode for encryption, the system SHOULD use a default passcode to wrap the
encryption key. If the device provides a hardware-backed keystore, the password
stretching algorithm MUST be cryptographically bound to that keystore. The
encryption key MUST NOT be sent off the device (even when wrapped with the user
passcode and/or hardware bound key). The upstream Android Open Source project
provides a preferred implementation of this feature based on the linux kernel
feature dm-crypt.</p>

<h2 id=9_10_verified_boot>9.10. Verified Boot</h2>


<p>Device implementations SHOULD support verified boot for device integrity, and
if the feature is supported it MUST declare the platform feature flag
android.software.verified_boot. While this requirement is stated as SHOULD for
this version of the Android platform, it is <strong>very strongly RECOMMENDED</strong> as we expect this to change to MUST in the future versions of Android. The
upstream Android Open Source Project provides a preferred implementation of
this feature based on the linux kernel feature dm-verity.</p>

<h1 id=10_software_compatibility_testing>10. Software Compatibility Testing</h1>


<p>Device implementations MUST pass all tests described in this section.</p>

<p>However, note that no software test package is fully comprehensive. For this
reason, device implementers are <strong>very strongly encouraged</strong> to make the minimum number of changes as possible to the reference and
preferred implementation of Android available from the Android Open Source
Project. This will minimize the risk of introducing bugs that create
incompatibilities requiring rework and potential device updates.</p>

<h2 id=10_1_compatibility_test_suite>10.1. Compatibility Test Suite</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST pass the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) [<a href="http://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html">Resources, 108</a>] available from the Android Open Source Project, using the final shipping
software on the device. Additionally, device implementers SHOULD use the
reference implementation in the Android Open Source tree as much as possible,
and MUST ensure compatibility in cases of ambiguity in CTS and for any
reimplementations of parts of the reference source code.</p>

<p>The CTS is designed to be run on an actual device. Like any software, the CTS
may itself contain bugs. The CTS will be versioned independently of this
Compatibility Definition, and multiple revisions of the CTS may be released for
Android 5.0. Device implementations MUST pass the latest CTS version available
at the time the device software is completed.</p>

<h2 id=10_2_cts_verifier>10.2. CTS Verifier</h2>


<p>Device implementations MUST correctly execute all applicable cases in the CTS
Verifier. The CTS Verifier is included with the Compatibility Test Suite, and
is intended to be run by a human operator to test functionality that cannot be
tested by an automated system, such as correct functioning of a camera and
sensors.</p>

<p>The CTS Verifier has tests for many kinds of hardware, including some hardware
that is optional. Device implementations MUST pass all tests for hardware that
they possess; for instance, if a device possesses an accelerometer, it MUST
correctly execute the Accelerometer test case in the CTS Verifier. Test cases
for features noted as optional by this Compatibility Definition Document MAY be
skipped or omitted.</p>

<p>Every device and every build MUST correctly run the CTS Verifier, as noted
above. However, since many builds are very similar, device implementers are not
expected to explicitly run the CTS Verifier on builds that differ only in
trivial ways. Specifically, device implementations that differ from an
implementation that has passed the CTS Verifier only by the set of included
locales, branding, etc. MAY omit the CTS Verifier test.</p>

<h1 id=11_updatable_software>11. Updatable Software</h1>


<p>Device implementations MUST include a mechanism to replace the entirety of the
system software. The mechanism need not perform "live" upgrades—that is, a
device restart MAY be required.</p>

<p>Any method can be used, provided that it can replace the entirety of the
software preinstalled on the device. For instance, any of the following
approaches will satisfy this requirement:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Over-the-air (OTA) downloads with offline update via reboot
  <li> "Tethered" updates over USB from a host PC
  <li> "Offline" updates via a reboot and update from a file on removable storage
</ul>

<p>However, if the device implementation includes support for an unmetered data
connection such as 802.11 or Bluetooth PAN (Personal Area Network) profile, the
device MUST support Over-the-air download with offline update via reboot.</p>

<p>The update mechanism used MUST support updates without wiping user data. That
is, the update mechanism MUST preserve application private data and application
shared data. Note that the upstream Android software includes an update
mechanism that satisfies this requirement.</p>

<p>For device implementations that are launching with Android 5.0 and later, the
update mechanism SHOULD support verifying that the system image is binary
identical to expected result following an OTA. The block-based OTA
implementation in the upstream Android Open Source Project, added since Android
5.0, satisfies this requirement.</p>

<p>If an error is found in a device implementation after it has been released but
within its reasonable product lifetime that is determined in consultation with
the Android Compatibility Team to affect the compatibility of third-party
applications, the device implementer MUST correct the error via a software
update available that can be applied per the mechanism just described.</p>
