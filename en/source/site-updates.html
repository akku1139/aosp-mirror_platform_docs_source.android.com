<h2 id="August-2017">August 2017</h2>

<p>Android 8.0 has been released! This section describes the major new features in the Android 8.0 platform.</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>

<h4>Treble</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 includes support for Treble, a major re-architect of the
Android OS framework designed to make it easier, faster, and less costly
for manufacturers to update devices to a new version of Android. Documentation
includes details on the <a href="/devices/architecture/hidl/index.html">HAL interface definition
language (HIDL)</a>, a new <a href="/devices/architecture/configstore/index.html">ConfigStore HAL</a>,
<a href="/devices/architecture/dto/index.html">Device Tree Overlays</a>,
the <a href="/devices/architecture/vndk/index.html">Vendor Native Development
Kit (VNDK)</a>, <a href="/devices/architecture/vintf/index.html">Vendor
  Interface Objects (VINTF)</a>, <a href="/devices/architecture/kernel/modular-kernels.html">
Modular Kernel requirements</a>, and the <a href="/devices/tech/vts/index.html">
Vendor Test Suite (VTS) and Infrastructure</a>.
</p>

<h4>FunctionFS support</h4>
<p>
<a class="external-link"
     href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/functionfs.txt">FunctionFS</a>
(FFS) is a USB gadget function that is designed and controlled through user space.
Its support allows all of the function- and protocol-specific code to live in
user space, while all of the USB transport code lives in the kernel. Using
     FFS moves Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) implementation into user space.
</p>

<p>
On the frameworks side, most of the major changes exist in MtpServer. The
USB driver interface has been refactored into two different classes, one that
uses the old kernel driver and one that uses FFS. MtpServer is then able
to use that driver interface without needing to know the details of
implementation. The FFS driver writes the USB descriptors to a file when
the server starts up; it then writes data to endpoint files similar to the
kernel driver use.
</p>

<h4>Kernel enhancements to LLDB/C++ debugging</h4>
<p>
The Android 8.0 release includes kernel enhancements that help developers create
better applications by improving their debugging experience. For more
information, see <a
href="/devices/architecture/kernel/lldb-debug.html">Implementing
kernel enhancements to LLDB/C++ debugging</a>.
</p>

<h4>Kernel Hardening</h4>
<p>
Upstreamed kernel hardening features and tools to find bugs in kernel drivers.
For more information, see <a
href="/devices/architecture/kernel/hardening.html">Kernel Hardening</a>.
</p>

<h4>Optimizing SquashFS at the Kernel Level</h4>
<p>
SquashFS is a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux, suitable for use on the
system partition. The optimizations in this document help improve the
performance of SquashFS. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/architecture/kernel/squashfs.html">Optimizing
SquashFS at the Kernel Level</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="art-dalvik">ART and Dalvik</h3>
<h4>Fuzz Testing</h4>
<p>
The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) offers a new fuzzing testing suite for
testing the <a href="/devices/tech/dalvik/">Android
runtime (ART)</a> infrastructure. The new toolset, JFuzz and an improved
DexFuzz, are directly available in AOSP now with accompanying documentation.
See:
<a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/art/+/master/tools/jfuzz/README.md">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/art/+/master/tools/jfuzz/README.md</a>
<a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/art/+/master/tools/dexfuzz/README">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/art/+/master/tools/dexfuzz/README</a>
</p>
<p>
Nothing is required to implement or use the new tools. You may make changes
to the tools if required, just like you can make changes to the
runtime/compiler already.
</p>

<h4>VDEX files: Improve System Update Performance</h4>
<p>
VDEX files improve the performance and user experience of software updates. VDEX
files store pre-validated DEX files with verifier dependencies so that during
system updates ART does not need to extract and verify the DEX files again. No
action is needed to implement this feature. It is enabled by default. To
disable the feature, set the <code>ART_ENABLE_VDEX</code> environment variable
to <code>false</code>.
</p>

<h4>ART performance improvements</h4>
<p>
The Android runtime (ART) has been improved significantly in the Android 8.0
release. This document summarizes enhancements device manufacturers can expect
in ART. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/dalvik/improvements.html">Improving
ART Performance in Android 8.0</a>.
</p>

<h4>Android A/B OTA Updates</h4>
<p>
This update answers common questions device manufacturers have regarding Android
A/B (seamless) system updates. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/ota/ab_updates#frequently-asked-questions.html">A/B
(Seamless) System Updates Frequently asked questions</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="automotive">Automotive</h3>

<h4>Bluetooth connection management</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 provides Bluetooth connection management in in-vehicle infotainment
systems for a more seamless Bluetooth user experience. For more information, see
<a href="/devices/automotive/ivi_connectivity.html#bluetooth-connection-management">
Bluetooth connection management</a>.
</p>

<h4>Bluetooth multi-device HFP</h4>
<p>
Bluetooth multi-device connectivity lets users connect multiple devices to telephony profiles in
an Android Automotive IVI Bluetooth. For more information, see
<a href="/devices/automotive/ivi_connectivity.html#bluetooth-multi-device-connectivity">
IVI Connectivity</a>.
</p>

<h4>Vehicle Camera HAL</h4>
<p>
Describes the design of an exterior view system (EVS) stack and provides the HAL
specification for supporting the acquisition and presentation of vehicle camera
data. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/automotive/camera-hal.html">Exterior
View System (EVS) Vehicle Camera HAL.</a>
</p>

<h3 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h3>
<p>
See the updated <a
href="/devices/bluetooth/index.html">Bluetooth
overview</a>.
</p>

<h4>Verifying and debugging Bluetooth</h4>
<p>
A new page about how to verify and debug the native Bluetooth stack. See this page at
<a href="/devices/bluetooth/verifying_debugging.html">Verifying and Debugging</a>.
</p>

<h4>Bluetooth services</h4>
<p>
Bluetooth provides a variety of features that enable core services between devices,
such as audio streaming, phone calls, and messaging. For more information about the Android
Bluetooth services, see <a href="/devices/bluetooth/services.html">
Bluetooth Services</a>.
</p>

<h4>BLE advertising</h4>
<p>
Bluetooth 5 supports different modes of data advertisements for Bluetooth Low Energy,
including higher bandwidth or increased range. For more information, see
<a href="/devices/bluetooth/ble_advertising.html">
Bluetooth Low Energy Advertising</a>.
</p>


<h4>Bluetooth support for audio codecs</h4>
<p>
The Android 8.0 release includes support for Bluetooth high-definition audio
codecs. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/bluetooth/services.html#advanced-audio-codecs">Advanced audio codecs</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="camera">Camera</h3>

<h4>Critical camera features</h4>
<p>
The Android 8.0 release contains these key enhancements to the Camera service:
shared surfaces, enable multiple surfaces sharing the same OutputConfiguration
System API for custom camera modes, and onCaptureQueueEmpty. For more
information, see <a
href="/devices/camera/versioning.html">Camera Version
Support</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

<h4>Ambient Capabilities</h4>
<p>
Capabilities allow Linux processes to drop most root-like privileges, while
retaining the subset of privileges that they require to perform their function.
Ambient capabilities allows system services to configure capabilities in their
<code>.rc</code> files, bringing all their configuration into a single file. For
more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/config/ambient.html">Implementing
Ambient Capabilities</a>.
</p>

<h4>Privileged Permission Whitelist Requirement</h4>
<p>
Starting in Android 8.0, all privileged apps must be explicitly whitelisted in
system configuration XML files in the <code>/etc/permissions</code> directory.
If they are not, then the device will boot, but the device implementation will
not pass CTS. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/config/perms-whitelist.html">Privileged
Permission Whitelist Requirement</a>.
</p>

<h4>Implementing USB HAL</h4>
<p>
The Android 8.0 release moves handling of USB commands out of init scripts and
into a native USB daemon for better configuration and code reliability. For more
information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/config/usb-hal.html">Implementing
USB HAL</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>

<h4>Customizing Device Behavior for Out-of-balance Users</h4>
<p>
Android devices with no data balance allow network traffic through, requiring
carriers and telecoms to implement mitigation protocols. This feature implements
a generic solution that allows carriers and telcos to indicate when a device has
run out of balance. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/connect/oob-users.html">Customizing
device behavior for out-of-balance users</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>

<h4>Enabling sanitizers in the Android build system</h4>
<p>
Sanitizers are compiler-based instrumentation components to use during
development and testing in order to identify bugs and make Android better.
Android's current set of sanitizers can discover and diagnose memory misuse bugs
and potentially dangerous undefined behavior. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/debug/sanitizers.html">Enabling
Sanitizers in the Android Build System</a>.
</p>

<h4>Recover devices in reboot loops</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 includes a feature that sends out a "rescue party" when it notices
core system components stuck in crash loops. Rescue Party then escalates through
a series of actions to recover the device. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/debug/rescue-party.html">Rescue
Party</a>.
</p>

<h4>Storaged</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 adds support for <code>storaged</code>, an Android native daemon that
collects and publishes storage metrics on Android devices. For more information,
see <a
href="/devices/tech/debug/storaged.html">Implementing
Storaged</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="display">Display</h3>

<h4>Air Traffic Control for floating windows</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 introduces Air Traffic Control for floating windows in order to
simplify and unify how apps display on top of other apps. Everything necessary
to use the feature is included in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
</p>
<p>
Air Traffic Control allows developers to create a new (managed) floating
layer/window type for apps to use to display windows on-top of other apps. The
feature displays ongoing notifications for all apps using a floating layer that
lets the user manage the alert window.
</p>
<p>
The Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) confirms:
</p> <ul>
 <li>The current alert window types are: <code>TYPE_PHONE</code>, <code>TYPE_PRIORITY_PHONE</code>,
<code>TYPE_SYSTEM_ALERT</code>, <code>TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY</code>, or <code>TYPE_SYSTEM_ERROR</code>
 <li>Apps targeting the O SDK won't be able to use the window types above to
display windows above other apps. They will need to use a new window type
TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY.
 <li>Apps targeting older SDKs can still use the current window types; however,
the windows will be z-ordered below the new TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY windows.
 <li>The system can move or resize windows in the new layer to reduce clutter.
 <li>Device manufacturers must keep the notification that lets users control
what is displayed over other apps.</li> </ul>

<h4>Launching activities on secondary displays</h4>
<p>
Virtual displays are available to everyone, and they don't require any special
hardware. Any application can create an instance of virtual display; and in the
Android 8.0 release, activities can be launched on that virtual display if the
associated feature is enabled.
</p>
<p>
To support multi-display features, you should either use one of the
existing supported ways of connecting secondary devices or build new hardware.
The supported ways of connecting displays on Nexus and Pixel devices are Google
Cast and <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/display/VirtualDisplay.html">virtual
displays inside apps</a>. Support of other ways depends on kernel driver support
for each particular case (like MHL or DisplayPort over USB-C) and fully
implementing interface definitions that are related to displays in
HardwareComposer HAL (IComposerCallback.hal and IComposerClient.hal).
</p>
<p>
Each of the ways may require SoC or OEM support. For example, to enable
DisplayPort over USB-C, both hardware (SOC) and software (drivers) support is
required. You might need to implement drivers for your hardware to support
connecting external displays.
</p>
<p>
The default implementation will allow launching fullscreen stacks of activities
on secondary displays. You can customize the stacks and System UI and
behavior on secondary displays.
</p>

<h4>Support for generic tooltip</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 allows developers to provide descriptive action names and other
helpful information on mouse hover over buttons and other icons. Device
manufacturers may style the tooltip popup. Its layout is defined in
<code>android/frameworks/base/core/res/res/layout/tooltip.xml</code>.
</a>
</p>
<p>
OEMs may replace the layout or change its dimensions and style parameters. Use
only text and keep the size reasonably small. The feature is implemented
entirely inside the View class, and there are quite exhaustive CTS tests that
check many aspects of Tooltip behavior.
</p>
<p>

<h4>Support for extended aspect ratio</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 includes a new manifest attribute, <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#maxAspectRatio">maxAspectRatio</a>,
which lets an activity or app specify the maximum aspect ratio it supports.
maxAspectRatio replaces the previous meta-data tag with a first-class API and
allows devices to support an aspect ratio greater than 16:9.
</p><ul>
<li>If an activity or app is <a
href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html#configuring">resizable</a>,
allow the activity to fill the screen.
<li>If an activity or app is non-resizeable or the platform is force resizing
the activity, allow the app window to display up to the maximum aspect ratio,
according to the <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#maxAspectRatio">maxAspectRatio</a>
value. <ul>
 <li>For applications on devices running Android 8.0, the default value is the
aspect ratio of the current device.
 <li>For applications on devices running earlier versions of Android, the
default value is 16:9.</li> </ul>
</li> </ul>

<h4>Implementing Adaptive Icons</h4>
<p>
Adaptive Icons maintain a consistent shape intra-device but vary from device to
device with only one icon asset provided by the developer. Additionally, icons
support two layers (foreground and background) that can be used for motion to
provide visual delight to users. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/display/adaptive-icons.html">Implementing
Adaptive Icons</a>.
</p>

<h4>Night Light</h4>
<p>
Night Light, introduced in Android 7.0.1, allows users to reduce the amount of
blue light that their screen emits. Android 8.0 gives users more control over the
intensity of this effect. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/display/night-light.html">Implementing
Night Light</a>.
</p>

<h4>Picture-in-picture</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 includes support for picture-in-picture (PIP) on Android handheld
devices. PIP allows users to resize an app with an ongoing activity, such as a
video, into a small window. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/display/pip.html">Picture-in-Picture
on Android handsets</a>.
</p>

<h4>Better Split-Screen Interactions</h4>
<p>
Multi-window lets multiple apps simultaneously display on users' device screens.
Android 8.0 improves the default mode, split-screen, by compressing the top pane
and resizing the launcher if a user taps Home after entering split-screen. For
more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/display/split-screen.html">Better
Split-Screen Interactions</a>.
</p>

<h4>Add Widgets/Shortcuts</h4>
<p>
A new API in Android 8.0 allows application developers to add shortcuts and
widgets from inside the app instead of relying on the widget tray. The older
method of adding shortcuts by sending a broadcast has been deprecated for
security reasons. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/display/widgets-shortcuts.html">Implementing
Add Widgets/Shortcuts</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="downloading-building">Downloading and Building</h3>

<h4>Android LLVM Toolchain improvements</h4>
<p>
OEMs who wish to use our latest toolchain/tools will need to ensure that any of
their private code compiles successfully with the updated toolchains. This may
require them to fix existing issues in their code with undefined behavior. (Of
course, they are free to use whatever tools they prefer to compile their own
code too.)
</p>
<p>
They must ensure their code is free of undefined behavior (by using tools like
UBSan), so they are less susceptible to problems caused by newer toolchains. All
of the toolchains are always updated directly in AOSP. Everything will be
available well before OC even ships, so OEMs should be following along
already.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="https://llvm.org/">public Clang/LLVM</a> documentation for
general instructions and the <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/clang/+/dev/ReadmeAndroid.md">Android
Clang/LLVM</a> documentation set within AOSP for Android-specific guidance.
Finally, join the <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-llvm">android-llvm</a>
public group to get help and take part in development.
</p>

<h3 id="drm-kms">DRM / KMS</h3>

<h4>DRM/KMS in Linux Kernel Version 4.9</h4>
<p>
The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)/Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) framework used by
Android is developed and maintained by Linux kernel developers in the Linux
kernel. Android merges down from the Linux kernel. By merging down from our
common kernel, device manufacturers gain the DRM/KMS framework automatically.
</p>
<p>
DRM/KMS became viable in Linux kernel version 4.9, and Android <strong>strongly
encourages</strong> OEM partners to use DRM/KMS starting with this kernel
version. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/565422/">Atomic Display Framework
(ADF)</a>, the display framework officially supported by Android today, will not
be supported in 4.9 and higher versions of the common Android kernel; instead,
Android will support DRM/KMS from this version. OEMs can continue to use ADF (or
any other framework), but Android will not support them in the common Android
kernel.
</p>
<p>
To implement DRM/KMS, you will need to write your own drivers using
DRM/KMS in addition to merging down the DRM/KMS framework from the android
common kernel.
</p>

<h3 id="keystore">Keystore</h3>

<h4>Keymaster 3</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 updates Keymaster, the keystore HAL, by extending the capabilities of
hardware-backed key storage on Android devices. This builds upon the Android 7.1.2
updates to Keymaster 2. For more information, see <a
href="/security/keystore/index.html">Keymaster 3 documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="security-enhancements">Security Enhancements</h3>

<h4>Insecure TLS Version Fallback removed from HttpsURLConnection</h4>
<p>
Insecure TLS/SSL protocol version fallback is a workaround for buggy
implementations of TLS protocol downgrade negotiation in some servers. This is
vulnerable to POODLE. When Chrome 45 dropped the insecure fallback in September
2015, less than 0.01% of servers relied on it. To improve security, insecure TLS
version fallback has been removed from <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/HttpsURLConnection.html">HttpsURLConnection</a>
in Android 8.0. For more details, see <a
href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/android-o-to-drop-insecure-tls-version.html
">this blog post</a>.
</p>
<p>
To test this feature on devices with Android 8.0, run this CTS test case:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy devsite-terminal" data-terminal-prefix="# ">
cts-tradefed run cts -m CtsLibcoreOkHttpTestCases</pre>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<h4>Flash Wear Management</h4>
<p>
Describes eMMC behavior and new features to help OEMs lower the risk of a
failing eMMC in the automotive environment. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/perf/flash-wear.html">Flash Wear
Management in Android Automotive</a>.
</p>

<h4>Optimizing Boot Times</h4>
<p>
Guidance for improving boot times for specific Android devices. For more
information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/perf/boot-times.html">Optimizing
boot times</a>.
</p>

<h4>Task Snapshots</h4>
<p>
Task Snapshots is infrastructure introduced in Android 8.0 that combines
screenshots for Recents Thumbnails as well as Saved Surfaces from Window Manager
to save memory. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/perf/task-snapshots.html">Task
Snapshots</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="peripherals">Peripherals</h3>

<h4>Default Print Services</h4>
<p>
A <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/printservice/PrintService.html">print
service</a> is an app that discovers and presents printers to a device's print
framework. In earlier Android versions, users had to search for and install
third-party print services to be able to print.
</p>
<p>
Android 8.0 includes a default print service in <code><a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/BuiltInPrintService/">platform/packages/services/BuiltInPrintService/</a></code>
that lets users print on modern printers without installing any additional apps.
This implementation supports printers that use the Internet Printing Protocol
(IPP) to communicate with the printer and use PCLm, PWG-Raster, or PDF to send
printable content. For older printers, users should install the app recommended
by the <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-7.0.0_r1/packages/PrintRecommendationService/">PrintRecommendationService</a>
as seen in this <a href="https://youtu.be/M_JGeGLpOKs?t=16m20s">this I/O presentation</a>.

<h3 id="reference">Reference Updates</h3>

<p>
The <a href="/reference/">Reference</a> section has been added to the top-level
navigation. As part of the <a href="/devices/architecture/treble">Treble</a>
release, a <a href="/reference/hidl/">HIDL reference</a> section was added.
The <a href="/reference/tradefed/">Trade Federation</a> and the
<a href="/reference/hal/">legacy HAL</a> reference documentation has been updated.
</p>

<h3 id="settings-menu">Settings menu</h3>

<h4>Settings: Patterns and Components</h4>
<p>
In Android 8.0, the Settings menu gains several components and widgets that
cover common uses. For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/settings/patterns-components.html">Patterns
and Components</a>.
</p>

<h4>Settings: Updated information architecture</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 introduces a new information architecture for the Settings app. The
goal of the new information architecture is to simplify the way settings are
organized and make it easier for users to quickly find the settings needed to
customize their Android devices. For more information, see Implementing <a
href="/devices/tech/settings/info-architecture.html">Updated
Information Architecture</a>.
</p>

<h4>Personalized Settings</h4>
<p>
The Android Settings app provides a list of suggestions to the users. This
feature provides ranking for suggestions, based on any contextual signal or the
user's past interactions with suggestions.  For more information, see <a
href="/devices/tech/settings/personalized.html">Personalized
Settings</a>.
</p>

<h4>Implementing Settings: Universal Search</h4>
<p>
Android 8.0 adds expanded search capabilities for the Settings menu. This document
describes how to add a setting and ensure it is properly indexed for Settings.
