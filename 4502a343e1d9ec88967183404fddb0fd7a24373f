      "message": "Nick\u0027s second comment directly addresses the reason for this change.  I think originally this was put in so that we could try to require some domains be enforcing, even as many others were not, rather than having a globally permissive policy, which was the case before.\n\nNow that we\u0027ve gone completely into enforcing, this actually suggests that some domains could be in permissive, which is weaker than our what we have now, and no longer allowed.",
