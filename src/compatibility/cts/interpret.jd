<p>The test results are placed in the file:</p>
<pre>
$CTS_ROOT/android-cts/repository/results/&lt;start_time>.zip
</pre>
<p><em>$CTS_ROOT</em> will resemble the path <em>out/host/linux-x86/cts</em> but will differ by
  platform.</p>
<p>Inside the zip, the testResult.xml file contains the actual results—open this
  file in any web browser (HTML5 compatible browser recommended) to view the test
  results. It will resemble the following screenshots.</p>

  <strong>Figure 1.</strong> CTS test summary
</p>

<p>The Device Information section provides details about the device, firmware
  (make, model, firmware build, platform), and device hardware (screen resolution,
  keypad, screen type).  To access device information, click the link above Test
  Summary.</p>
<p>The <em>Test Summary</em> section provides executed test plan details, like the CTS
  plan name and execution start and end times. It also presents an aggregate
  summary of the number of tests that passed, failed, timed out, or could not be
  executed.</p>
<p>The next section also provides a summary of tests passed per package.</p>

  <strong>Figure 2.</strong> CTS test report
</p>

<p>This is followed by details of the the actual tests that were executed. The
  report lists the test package, test suite, test case, and the executed tests.
  It shows the result of the test execution—pass, fail, timed out, or not
  executed. In the event of a test failure details are provided to help diagnose
  the cause.</p>
<p>Further, the stack trace of the failure is available in the XML file but is not
  included in the report to ensure brevity—viewing the XML file with a text
  editor should provide details of the test failure (search for the <em>&lt;Test&gt;</em> tag corresponding to the failed test and look within it for the <em>&lt;StackTrace&gt;</em> tag).</p>
