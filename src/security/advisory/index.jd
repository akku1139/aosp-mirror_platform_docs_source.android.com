<p>Android Security Advisories are a supplement to the
<a href="{@docRoot}security/bulletin/">Nexus Security Bulletins</a>.
We publish advisories to address issues that may not require security patches
or Nexus device updates, but could still affect an Android customerâ€™s overall
security. Nexus Security Bulletins are accompanied by
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">factory device images</a>
and over-the-air (OTA) device updates to protect customers against known
security issues in the Android ecosystem. Android Security Advisories are meant
to provide customers detailed information and guidance on Android-related
security issues potentially <em>without</em> an accompanying software update.</p>

<p>However, when updates are available to address issues described in an Android
Security Advisory, those updates will be made available in a Nexus Security
Bulletin for Nexus devices. In the Nexus Security Bulletin, we will reference
the Android Security Advisories that the bulletin addresses.</p>

<p>As with the bulletins, join the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/android-security-updates">Android Security Updates</a>
group to receive a notification when we publish an advisory.</p>
