<p>Before you download and build the Android source, ensure your system meets
  the following requirements. Then see <a href="initializing.html">Initializing a
  Build Environment</a> for installation instructions by operating system.</p>

<h2 id=hardware-requirements>Hardware requirements</h2>

<p>Your development workstation should meet or exceed these hardware requirements:</p>

<ul>

  <li>A 64-bit environment is required for Gingerbread (2.3.x) and newer versions, including the master
  branch. You can compile older versions on 32-bit systems.
  </li>

  <li>At least 100GB of free disk space for a checkout, 150GB for a single
  build, and 200GB or more for multiple builds. If you employ ccache, you will
  need even more space.</p>
  </li>

  <li>If you are running Linux in a virtual machine, you need at
  least 16GB of RAM/swap.
  </li>

</ul>
