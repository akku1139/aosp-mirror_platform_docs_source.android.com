<p>To ensure minimal support for managed profiles, OEM devices must contain the
following essential elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profile owner (as described in
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/enterprise/app-compatibility.html">Ensuring
  Compatibility with Managed Profiles</a>)</li>
  <li>Device owner</li>
  <li>Activation code provisioning</li>
  </ul>

<p>For a complete list of requirements, see
<a href="{@docRoot}devices/tech/admin/implement.html">Implementing Device
Administration</a>.</p>

<p>To test device administration features, device owners can use the TestDPC
application (described below); consider also working directly with other
enterprise mobility management (EMM) providers.</p>

<h2 id=set_up_the_device_owner_for_testing>Set up device owner for testing</h2>
<p>Use the following instructions to set up a device owner testing environment.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up the device:
  <ol>
  <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">Ensure the device uses a
  <strong>userdebug</strong> or <strong>eng</strong> build.</li>
  <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">Factory reset the target device.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Set up the testing application using one of the following methods:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afwsamples.testdpc&hl=en">Download
  the TestDPC application</a> (available from Google Play).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc/">Build
  the TestDPC application</a> (available from github.com).</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Set the TestDPC app as the device owner using the following command:<br>
  <pre>$ adb shell dpm set-device-owner "com.afwsamples.testdpc/.DeviceAdminReceiver"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Go through device owner setup on the device (encrypt, select Wi-Fi, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=verify_the_device_owner_was_correctly_setup>Verify device owner setup</h2>
<p>To verify the device owner was correctly setup, go to <em>Settings >
Security > Device Administrators</em> and confirm TestDPC is in the
list. Verify it cannot be disabled (this signifies it is a device owner).</p>

<h2 id=automate>Automated provisioning testing</h2>
<p>To automate the testing of enterprise provisioning processes, use
the Android for Work (AfW) Test Harness. For details, see
<a href="{@docRoot}devices/tech/admin/testing-provision.html">Testing Device
Provisioning</a>.</p>
