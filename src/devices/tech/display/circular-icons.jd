<p>Circular app icons are supported on Android 7.1 and later. Circular app
icons are not enabled by default. To use circular icons in your device
implementation, you must edit the resource overlay on your device to enable
them.</p>

<p>The resource overlay file is at <a
href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/res/res/values/config.xml">/android/frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml</a>

<p>To enable circular icons, change the <code>config_useRoundIcon</code>
setting, shown below, from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!-- Flag indicating whether round icons should be parsed from the application manifest. --&gt;
&lt;bool name="config_useRoundIcon"&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;
</pre>
