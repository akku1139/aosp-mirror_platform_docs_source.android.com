<p>Device manufacturers must provide a component power profile in
<code>/frameworks/base/core/res/res/xml/power_profile.xml</code>.</p>

<p>To determine values for power profiles, use hardware that measures the power
being used by the device and perform the various operations for which
information is needed. Measure the power use during those operations and compute
the values (deriving differences from other baseline power uses as appropriate).

&lt;!-- Most values are the incremental current used by a feature, in mA (measured at
nominal voltage). OEMs must measure and provide actual values before shipping a device.
Example real-world values are given, but are dependent on the platform
and can vary significantly, so should be measured on the shipping platform with a power meter.
